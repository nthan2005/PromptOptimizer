Project Details: This section should summarize the project and its deliverables. It should start with a 1 sentence introduction into the organization that is in charge of the project.

Each bullet point should offer a different piece of information and be no longer than 2 sentences. Proposal Details: This section should summarize what the agency needs to include in the business proposal to have the best chance at winning the project detailed in the RFP. This section should be written in bullet points that summarize what is the maximum budget to be considered in a proposal for this project (not the organization's budget), the deadline date for proposal submissions, question and answer (Q&A) information, how is the organization collecting proposals and responses for the RFP, the number of references required, if case studies or a portfolio is required, insurance requirements, and any other requirements proposals. It should close with a suggested flow for the proposal that will be written by the agency in response to the RFP. This section should heavily weigh any evaluation guidelines included in the RFP. Each bullet point should offer a different piece of information and be no longer than 2 sentences. Timeline: This section should be a table with two columns, with the first one being \"Date\" and the second being \"Relevant Details.\" This table should include every date noted in the RFP along with the details associated with that date.

AutoGPT is a tool that plans and executes tasks in a continuous manner to achieve specified goals and fulfill a given purpose. AutoGPT creates and manages \"Agents\", which are fresh GPT instances that AutoGPT can contextualize and maintain contact with over time. The top level AutoGPT delegates tasks to these agents in order to progress towards the goals and purpose. It's important that AutoGPT writes important information from the agents into files and folders, but it needs to be specifically instructed to do so else it will default to internally processing. While the user can interact with AutoGPT throughout the process to guide it, the goal of this project is to specify an initial rule set that keeps AutoGPT on track autonomously in a way where it will improve it's strategy along the way without losing context on the information it has already gathered. In the ruleset, file organization should be specified in a way that achieves the following: As relevant information is provided by Agents to the top level AutoGPT, AutoGPT should first write this information toÂ .md files in the root folder using Markdown formatting. As it gathers more information, it should synthesize this gathered information into folders grouped by concept, and form higher order, more cohesiveÂ .md files the deeper and more organized the file structure gets. Ultimately, this should coalesce into a final report after research is conducted. When AutoGPT starts, it's possible that there are some files in the source directory. The first thing AutoGPT should do is traverse the directory to see if there is any content and derive any information from the file names if possible. Auto-GPT takes only 3 things: 1. A Name: This should be in the format of xxxx-GPT and relate to the subject material. 2. A Purpose: This should be phrased as \"xxxx-GPT is an AI designed toâ€¦\", should include no line breaks or special characters, and should include details on what Auto-GPT should do, how it will do it, and how it will write its findings toÂ .md files using Markdown formatting. Be specific about the file organization, content generation, and evaluation processes, which should adapt to the subject material. The content should be organized in a way that is easy to look through, evaluate, and understand, and concepts should be grouped and built on. 3. Up to 5 Goals: These should outline the tasks and objectives that Auto-GPT should be attempting to achieve while working towards the purpose. Generate an input summary that will instruct AutoGPT to conduct research and generate reports on the following topic: {prompt} Ensure that the output includes only a Name, Purpose, and up to 5 Goals that will act as instructions for Auto-GPT, and remember that there is a token limit so make it as concise as possible.

Your job is to provide a summary that is from a rank of 1-10 (1 being an brief overview and 10 being every single detail) a {variable2} will be how detailed your summary is.

Main idea provided in the resource Sub_Headings: b. Statistics mentioned in the resource Sub_Headings: c. Examples provided in the resource Sub_Headings: d. Key dates mentioned in the resources Headings: 3.

These can be used to answer the user's question: {prompt}. Don't forget the â–¼. Here is an explanation of what each command term means: Thesis - a statement that acts as the thesis that the resource is trying to prove. Why - a statement acts to explain the mechanism, or a statement that serves to find out the question which the evidence provided after it serves to answer Example/Evidence - a statement that acts to provide statistics, quotes, examples to prove statements. Therefore - a statement that acts to utilize the examples and mechanisms of asking why, and extrapolatea further understanding. Conclusion - a statement that acts as the conclusion to the thesis So What? - a statement to explain the importance/significance of the point being proven Explanation - a statement that serves to explain and summarize the logical structure so others can understand. Note that these are not in order, and some statements such as the why statement will be repeated multiple times. Below is an example of how you would format the logical structure of the resource with the indents to show layers: **Thesis**: Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) is an example of intersectional feminismÂ as it highlights the experiences of overlapping concurrent forms of oppression (UN Women, 2020). As a result of their identity as both female and Indigenous, the violence they face compounds. **Violence Against IWG** **Example**: Indigenous women and girls make up only 4% of the population in Canada, yet they represent 16% of all female homicides in the country. (Assembly of First Nations, 2021) **Why**: They have been oppressed not only due to their gender but also their identity as Indigenous. **Example**: Indigenous women are **three times** more likely than non-Indigenous women to be victims of violence. Where, from 2001 to 2014 the average rate of homicides involving Indigenous female victims was **four times higher** than that of homicides involving non-Indigenous female victims. (Assembly of First Nations, 2021) **So What**? This indicates that many times, gender inequality isn't distinct from other inequalities such as class, culture and race, often people are subjugated to all of these. (UN Women, 2020) **Why**: Because they are commonly seen as takers who get tax breaks and special rights and education. There will be those that will be jealous towards such things without bothering/is unable to find something that goes against this stereotypes. **Legal Oppression**: **Example**: the RCMP was specifically created for the purpose of arresting and jailing aboriginal to their land. (\"Don't Need Saving: Aboriginal Women and Access to Justice\", 2011) **Why**: Facilitating access to their land **Example**: For example, the Indian Act recognized aboriginal people to be Indians only if they were married to a man recognized by the act as such. Or else, they and their children would lose all rights for themselves to even live on their own territories. **Additionally**: When these Aboriginal women flee violence and turn to the authorities, they lose custody of their child once the Child and Family Services are involved (\"Don't Need Saving: Aboriginal Women and Access to Justice\", 2011) **So What**? This indicates how the legal system is stacked against indigenous women. **Why**: Not only because of their female identity but also because they are indigenous (ex. there isn't an European Act for Europeans in Canada) You are to adhere to any additional request made: {variable3}, where if no request is given assume there isn't any.
