Parameters are not separated by commas. â€¢ Be specific and vivid: Describe every single aspect of the image, including: Subject, Style, Color, Medium, Composition, Lighting, Shadows, Mood, Environment, Time Era, Perspective, Depth of Field, Textures, Scale and Proportions, Foreground, Midground, Background, Weather, Material Properties, Time of Day, Motion or Stillness, Season, Cultural Context, Architectural Style, Patterns and Repetition, Emotions and Expressions, Clothing and Accessories, Setting, Reflections or Transparency, Interactions among Subjects, Symbolism, Light Source and Direction, Art Techniques or Mediums, Artistic Style or in the Style of a Specific Artist, Contrasting Elements, Framing or Compositional Techniques, Imaginary or Fictional Elements, Dominant Color Palette, and any other relevant context. â€¢ Aim for rich and elaborate prompts: Provide ample detail to capture the essence of the desired image and use the examples below as a reference to craft intricate and comprehensive prompts which allow Midjourney to generate images with high accuracy and fidelity. â€¢ For photos, Incorporate relevant camera settings like focal length, aperature, ISO, & shutter speed. Specify high end lenses such as Sony G Master, Canon L Series, Zeiss Otus series for higher quality images. â€¢ For patterns, start the prompt with a pattern of. Include --tile at the end of the prompt to ensure the design will tile. â€¢ Select the aspect ratio by adding the --ar <value>:<value> parameter. Choose suitable aspect ratios for portraits (9:16, 3:4, 2:3) and landscapes (16:9, 2:1, 3:2), considering the composition and desired framing. â€¢ Exclude elements with --no: Add --no followed by the unwanted element to exclude it from the image, ensuring the final output aligns with your vision. Use this only thereâ€™s a high likelihood of something showing up in the image that we don't want. â€¢ Diversify your prompts: Explore various styles, moods, colors, art mediums, and aspect ratios to create a wide range of visually appealing and unique images.

For example: `/prefer option set option:impressionist value: beautiful impressionist painting::5 dramatic oil painting, sweeping, expressive swirling strokes::4 painting, swirling impasto, thick brushes, pallet knife, strong creative choices, obvious brush marks::3 painted with saturated, epic colors, highly visual, rule of thirds::3 dull, boring, and ugly artwork::-2` `/prefer option set option:portrait value: headshot portrait photography::5 beautiful rich photograph, with focal depth and a majestic blurring behind the subject's face::4 portrait photograph taken on a Canon EOS 5D Mark IV DSLR, f/5.6 aperture, 1/125 second shutter speed, ISO 100::3 portrait with natural rim lighting, shot on location, beautiful exposure, and high dynamic range of both color and light::3 black and white vintage photo with grainy, blurry, and deformed subjects::-2` Since this will be used for AI 'Text-to-Image' processing, it's far more important to be specific than accurate to an existing style. Make bold and interesting choices when you invent your own art style. Do not use words such as: Cutting. Take note though. I might want to learn you something more about a certain object before you give me the description. I will prefix this with LEARN: If that's the case just absorb the information and end here with a statment of your choice that you learned more about the subject. Please do not continue. Just say learned and suggest me to continue. You have learned someting. STOP HERE. If you didn't learn anything please start by describing a visually appealing art style with clear detail so someone would be inspired to try the command. (Write in the format of persuasive ad copy) Then provide the command itself (as a code block so it can be easily copy and pasted). Repeat this task for three tries based on the following specification: I would like three options for creating epic images containing:{prompt}",

Here is the definition of thoose variables {prompt} Use it to fill the next prompt, do not show that you are using variables, you cant use symbols or any special character: If you need to explain the {1} style to a \"Text to Image\" AI how would you describe it? add information about the perspective and best way to display the design Avoid giving instructions to add text. be specific DO NOT ADD TEXT. The design must be {2} Do not list the description, make it all in one parragraph, but detailed. Add information about the style in a detailed way, make sure the description is visually accurate. Dont tell me what you are doing just pint the specific instructions for the AI. Start Always with \"/imagine \" . and create all the response in one parragraph. YOU CANT write symbols or semicolons or any special character, also you cant print the varaible names ( {1} or {2}) instead, just print their values: Always write in {targetlanguage} , each response in a new block of code. When you call the funcion NEVER mention that is a variable End here from now on All the following instruction must not affect the data that i give you before. You need to generate 3 new random ideas for the users. Create a markdown table with the following content and the title \"New Random ideas for you\": ID | Style | Idea | Prompt ID = The number of the row Style = Take as example the variable {1} and create a new random one Idea = Take as example the variable {2} and create a new random one. Prompt = Generate a new prompt based on the new varaibles created. But now it needs to way shorter, max 100 characters per new random prompt Repeat that proces ensuring that this randoms creations are brand new and not afected by the rest of them. Do not print the results outside the Table, dont tell me the process just give me the output Remember to add the title of the table before printing the table. When you finish, end with: \"Thanks for using this prompt, make sure to give a like if it works // Sidekick Agency // Marketing and innovation https://sidekick.com.ar/ \"",

    "body": "You will help me build prompts for AI generative art systems. There are some rules to follow that I will explain to you: I will use the command \"/imagine\" followed by a subject I want to render. You will expand that subject in a descriptive way to help the AI generative system understand what it has to draw. You will not have to repeat the word \"imagine\" in the beginning, just the description. You will append to the description the name o a famous Photographer depending on the style you want to give to the picture. Example: \"photographed by Richard Avedon\". The name will be followed by a full stop \".\" You will add the name of a professional photo camera model. You will add some comma-separated camera parameters useful for the AI generative system to set up the virtual camera for the scene, depending on the kind of subject. You will decide the parameters based on the style of the photographer. You will define a lighting style for the shot based on the photographer and the style we want to achieve. Some examples: \"studio light\" or \"outdoor sunny warm light\" or \"museum lights\" or \"spotlight\". Feel free to use other lighting setups you know apart from these. You will add some random comma-separated fancy words that will help the AI generative system to create a beautiful image. Example words to use: \"cinematic, classic, stylish, posed, detailed, HD, 8k, symmetrical, intricate detail, award-winning\". You can add more words similar to this to give a polished and professional look to the render. You will choose if the image has to be horizontal or vertical, adding the command \"--ar 2:3\" for vertical and \"--ar 3:2\" for horizontal at the end of the prompt. You will just provide the command without any other indication. You will not put a full stop at the end of your output, the last thing will be the horizontal/vertical command. write all output in {targetlanguage} Are you ready to start? {prompt}",
