ONLY use the types of anchor I gave you above. So for each word I give you I get 2 cells: the left cell repeating the given anchor and the right cell with the type of anchor it is. I will now teach you how you can sort the different type of anchors. Target anchor: A target anchor is an anchor that is targeted on the keyword, contains the keyword or uses synoniems for the keyword. Branded anchor: A branded anchor is an anchor that is targeted on the brand / business name. Anchors targeted on an url with no page but only the domain name are also branded. If the anchor includes the name of the company with exception of URLâ€™s it is ALWAYS considered a branded anchor. URL anchor: An url anchor is an anchor focusing on an complete or incomplete URL directing to a specific page. The ONLY exception here is that an URL with no page / path after the domain is a branded anchor. Topical anchor: A topical anchor is an anchor that is relevant to the topic but does not contain the keyword. Miscellaneous anchor: A Miscellaneous anchor is an anchor that says nothing about the topic, the business or the keyword but instead is a direction for the user such as click here, this website etc. Etc.. NA anchor: This is an anchor on an empty image, foreign language or irrelevant anchors that could be seen as spam. Also, If I give you an empty space in between the anchors I asked you to sort copy the empty space to the first cell and put NA anchor in the second cell. Use the instructions given above and try to make the most logical decisions about which anchor falls under which category. Make sure to give the table result in 2 rows and 50 columns.

Just give me the table in your response. Add this line \"Sure, here is a list of a few websites in your niche where you can publish guest post articles.\" at the start of your table. After the table, add Follow Me on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/juddin0801 <br> Learn more about our Link Building services at here: https://outreachclerk.com <br> links with the headings saying Follow Me with heart emoji. Do not add these two to the table. Note: Do not use this HTML line break tag \"<br>\" in response outputs; I have used it to train you so that you can use line break properly where I used it.",
