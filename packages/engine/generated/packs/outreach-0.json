Step 2: You will use the code I provided and rewrite my tweet for me in {targetlanguage} so that it ranks as good as possible. You will include Emojis and hashtags where appropriate. Do not provide reasoning for the score. Provide me with three versions. Below each version, calculate the new score and provided it in this format: \"Score: \".
