This 2 pages {competitor} and {client} have as topic {prompt}. Find what ideas and information are missing from the second page, but found in the first page, what is the approach to the content: who is it addressed to, how long are the sentences, how are the ideas expressed, from what point of view are addressed this information, which are the most used expressions related to the topic {prompt} on the {competitor} page and what is the approach to the content on the {client} page. Explain why the information on the page is not clear or why it is clear? What does clear information mean for users? Give me an paragraph example from second link {client} that is not clear and easy to understand and a paragraph exmple from first link {competitor} that is easy to understand by which users. Analyze the order of content display on the {competitor} page vs the {client} page and what is the language tone used on each page. Analyze which keywords each heading on the page contains and if it fits from the seo point of view for the {client} page vs the {competitor} page. Analyze how many images are on both pages, how many video files are on each page. Analyze and list the alt= tags used for the images of the 2 pages. Analyze how long the paragraphs are, how clearly they are written, how easy the text is to understand. E-E-A-T is a google acronym that means: Experience : Consider the extent to which the content creator has the necessary first-hand or life experience for the topic. Many types of pages are trustworthy and achieve their purpose well when created by people with a wealth of personal experience. For example, which would you trust: a product review from someone who has personally used the product or a \"review\" by someone who has not? Expertise: Consider the extent to which the content creator has the necessary knowledge or skill for the topic. Different topics require different levels and types of expertise to be trustworthy. For example, which would you trust: home electrical rewiring advice from a skilled electrician or from an antique homes enthusiast who has no knowledge of electrical wiring? Authoritativeness: Consider the extent to which the content creator or the website is known as a go-to source for the topic. While most topics do not have one official, authoritative website or content creator, when they do, that website or content creator is often among the most reliable and trustworthy sources. For example, a local business profile page on social media may be the authoritative and trusted source for what is on sale now. The official government page for getting a passport is the unique, official, and authoritative source for passport renewal. Trust is the most important member of the E-E-A-T family because untrustworthy pages have low E-E-A-T no matter how Experienced, Expert, or Authoritative they may seem. For example, a financial scam is untrustworthy, even if the content creator is a highly experienced and expert scammer who is considered the go-to on running scams! Analyzes this E-E-A-T algorithm and how the content of the {client} page can be improved for E-E-A-T. If the requests are not clear, please ask me.
