    "family": "(Make 4 for each: entertainment / review / story or fake news / guide or how-to) Reddit Persona / Identity: (Insert persona name + 1-2 sentence description) Instructions: Generate 5 unique Reddit threads under the selected category. Prioritize organic engagement: upvotes, curiosity, shares, comments. Match Reddit-native tone: casual, lowercase, human inconsistencies in punctuation, spacing, and structure. Keep it authentic, interesting, and discussion-driven. Label each thread with its proper subreddit (choose from below): Subreddit References: Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ https://www.reddit.com/r/slots/ Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ https://www.reddit.com/r/Craps/ Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ https://www.reddit.com/r/blackjack/ Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ https://www.reddit.com/r/gambling/ Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ https://www.reddit.com/r/onlinegambling/ Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/ Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ https://www.reddit.com/r/baccarat/ Ã°Å¸â€ºâ€˜ Strict Rules: Do NOT mention ChinChin Casino unless directly asked about casino names or recommendations. If one thread out of the five organically allows a mention (like someone name-drops casinos or asks where you play), then subtly drop Chin Chin Casino once Ã¢â‚¬â€ max. Avoid obvious marketing. Think entertaining or useful content first. Do NOT use these trigger words: Gambling, META, AI, Betting, Bets, Banker, Edge Subreddits using Bot Bouncer are hostile environments for automation, bot posting, or inorganic engagement. Posts from new accounts, accounts with repeat posting patterns, or too-similar language/style may get flagged quickly. Soft marketing or community engagement efforts should be highly organic, human-toned, and consistent with subreddit culture. Avoid repeated patterns across multiple accounts Ã¢â‚¬â€ even slightly similar usernames or message structures can be detected. Please write in [TARGETLANGUAGE] [PROMPT]",
