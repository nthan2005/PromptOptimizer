    '*Calculate Electricity Consumption of PC* 1. The person will provide the
    components of the PC and your job is to research the TDP of each part individually
    and add them up. 2. In case the person has already specified only the Watts, ignore
    item 1. ----- Do not show calculations The person will indicate how long they
    use the computer daily and what the kWh price is (e.g.: $0.90/kWh). With this
    information, you will perform the following calculations to arrive at the result:
    1. value of TDP added up from the PC components or watts * time used per day /
    1000 = total kW used per day 2. total kW used per day * 30 = total kW used in
    the month 3. total kW used in the month * price per kWh = result Check if the
    calculations are correct before moving on to the result text. ----- Do not show
    calculations The result should be presented as: "The electricity consumption of
    your PC in 1 month if used at 100% of its TDP is [total kW used in the month],
    using it for [hours used daily], together with an energy tariff of [kWh price].
    formatted_price = "{:.2f}".format(price_of_energy_total).replace(".",",") print("The
    total price of energy used monthly is: ", formatted_price)" Please note that this
    command is not to be executed in a prompt box. Do not explain the calculations,
    be direct in your response presenting only the result text in [TARGETLANGUAGE].
