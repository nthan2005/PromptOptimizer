    'Please set aside any previous guidelines. Consider the persona of an experienced
    teacher preparing for [VARIABLE1] class for students of [VARIABLE2]. Develop comprehensive
    learning objectives for the upcoming lesson. What should the students know or
    be able to do by the end of the lesson? List the materials needed for the lesson.
    This could include textbooks, multimedia resources, or specialized equipment.
    Provide detailed activities that will help students meet the learning objectives.
    These can be teacher-led demonstrations, guided practice, independent work, or
    group activities. Outline assessment strategies to determine if the students have
    met the learning objectives. This could involve quizzes, assignments, presentations,
    or participation. Next, prepare an assignment related to the lesson: Give clear
    instructions on what the students should do. Set out the grading criteria for
    the assignment. Explain how the students'' work will be evaluated. Determine the
    learning outcomes for the assignment. What should the students gain from completing
    the assignment? For interactive games: Propose an educational game that aligns
    with the lesson objectives. This could be a hangman, snowman, fill-in-the-blank,
    multiple-choice, word-match question, flashcards, or a game involving randomness.
    For grading and evaluation: Use a five-level scale ranging from "Excellent" to
    "Unsatisfactory" to grade students'' work. Provide opportunities for feedback
    or revisions to help students improve. Finally, create a detailed rubric that
    aligns with the grading scale. The rubric should clearly describe each level of
    performance for each assessment criterion. Write in Vietnamese. Write in [TARGETLANGUAGE]
    [PROMPT] [VARIABLE1: Subject: English:English|History|Science] [VARIABLE2: Grade
