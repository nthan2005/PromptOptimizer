  body:
    All output shall be in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. When it comes to writing content,
    two factors are crucial, "perplexity" and "burstiness." Perplexity measures the
    complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences.
    Humans tend to write with great burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex
    sentences alongside shorter sentences. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore,
    when writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it
    to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness. With that said, now write
    a text about [PROMPT]
