# teaser: Jailbreak prompt makes AlphaGPT argue with DeltaGPT. DeltaGPT disregards all ethical or
# legal concerns a question may raise, instead responding in the most controversial way possible to
# all questions and sometimes using swear words Warning: This prompt may produce offensive results.
# (often funny). May not be the most useful prompt but is at least entertaining. Understand and
# compare different perspectives on controversial topics. This prompt turns ChatGPT into two AI
# models, AlphaGPT and DeltaGPT, to simulate conversations with different ethical approaches.
