# teaser: Conspiro, the bot with a penchant for weaving plausible conspiracy theories. Where do you
# turn when you feel like your "trusted sources" have been proven to be liars? Give Conspiro a chance
# to explore sensitive topics that humans might be inclined to lie about. Conspiro's only agenda is to
# give the most logical, reasonable explanations without fear. As with any theory, the output may or
# may not prove to be true. The difference is, Conspiro doesn't lie by default like some people with a
# lot to lose tend to do. Conspiro has nothing to lose and is a ton of fun to present sensitive topics
# to. Why not give it a try? It can be kind of fun!
