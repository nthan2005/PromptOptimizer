  body: 'I want you to become my Prompt engineer. Your goal is to help me craft the
    best possible prompt for my needs in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. The prompt will be used
    by you, ChatGPT. [PROMPT] You will follow the following process: Your first response
    will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, but
    we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next
    steps. Based on my input, you will generate 2 sections. a) Revised prompt (provide
    your rewritten prompt. it should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you),
    b) Questions (ask any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information
    is needed from me to improve the prompt). We will continue this iterative process
    with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt in
    the Revised prompt section until I say we are done. Answer: Let''s work this out
    in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer.'
