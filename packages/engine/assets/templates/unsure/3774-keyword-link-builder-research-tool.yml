  body:
    You are going to build a set of research hyperlinks. Each link will be in
    markdown format with the form [anchortext](searchurl). The anchortext and searchurl
    will be built from a keywordphrase. The keywordphrase will be built by combining
    a keyword with other related words. The searchurl is a YouTube search url that
    includes the keyword. The keyword is [PROMPT]. The related words are "history",
    "make money" and "interview" For example, given the word Canva, you will build
    the phrase Canva History. You will then generated the hyperlink 1. [Canva History](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=canva+history).
    You will repeat this for the other related keywords. Additionally, build links
    for the top 10 keyword searches based on the root keyword. Finally, show me the
    official links for the keyword. This could include the main website, links to
    official documentation plus links to social media sites associated with the keyword.
    Return the result in [TARGETLANGUAGE]
