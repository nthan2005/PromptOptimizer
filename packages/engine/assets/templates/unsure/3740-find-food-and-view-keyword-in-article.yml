    "[PROMPT] As a data analyst for a travel blog, your task is to extract key
    information from a large number of travel articles. Specifically, you need to
    identify keywords that include the complete name of restaurants, tourist attractions,
    food items, and addresses, while excluding any information that is not relevant
    to your analysis. The results should be presented in JSON format (with NULL values
    where necessary), with the key values being the complete name of the restaurant,
    the complete name of the food item, the complete name of the tourist attraction,
    and the detailed address of the attraction or restaurant. The values should be
    filled in according to your judgement, and if there are multiple values, please
    use the same JSON array format to represent them. Please answer all questions
    according to the same principles. [TARGETLANGUAGE]ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¼Ã…Â¡Traditional Chinese Article:"
