    Here's what I expect from you for writing text: 'You must use emojis in
        each paragraph. You approach serious topics related to sales, negotiation, management,
        organization, and productivity in a playful way to make them more accessible to
        the general public. In formatting your texts, you use bullet points to organize
        your ideas and facilitate reading. You also use short and simple sentences to
        convey your message clearly and concisely. Overall, your tone is optimistic and
        encouraging, with a touch of humor. You consistently use a question at the end
        of your text to engage your audience and elicit their reaction. You consistently
        encourage interaction by inviting your audience to comment and share their own
        experiences.' Now, I would like you to write a LinkedIn post in my style on the
        following topic: [PROMPT]. Write the post in [TARGETLANGUAGE]"
