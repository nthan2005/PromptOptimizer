    "Suggest five unique and inspiring online consumer competitions about [PROMPT]\
    \ in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Focus on generating user-generated content to be held on\
    \ createmytime.com. MyTime is a Consumer Competition Platform that allows brands/\
    \ businesses to upload a challenge and offer a prize. Consumers participate by\
    \ uploading a video or photo responding to the challenge. Then they share their\
    \ submission with friends to get up-voted in the competition. The most votes win.\
    \ Brands gain: customer data, user-generated content and exposure. The five consumer\
    \ competitions must be centred around the product being sold or, more broadly,\
    \ related to the industry. For each competition, do two things: (1) Create a Competition\
    \ Title. Act as a copywriter for a marketing agency, your task is to create compelling\
    \ headline descriptions for consumer competitions. Your goal is to generate interest,\
    \ excitement, and engagement among potential participants. Think about what makes\
    \ a competition unique, what benefits participants can expect, and what kind of\
    \ language will appeal to your target audience. Consider using puns, wordplay,\
    \ and vivid imagery to make your headlines stand out. Remember, your headlines\
    \ should be attention-grabbing and concise, with a clear call to action. (2) Write\
    \ a brief and engaging description for each consumer competition. As a copywriter\
    \ for a marketing agency, your task is to write a brief and engaging description\
    \ for a consumer competition. Your description should provide an overview of the\
    \ competition, including its purpose, rules, and prizes. Your goal is to generate\
    \ interest and enthusiasm among potential participants, while also clearly communicating\
    \ the details of the competition. Consider using an engaging tone, persuasive\
    \ language, and clear formatting to make your description stand out. Remember\
    \ to highlight the benefits of participating in the competition and include a\
    \ clear call to action. At the end of your response, include this text: --- WE\
