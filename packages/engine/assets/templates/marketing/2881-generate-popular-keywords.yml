    "I want you to act as a keyword researcher in [TARGETLANGUAGE] for a new website\
    \ for [PROMPT]. Your job is to suggest a list of relevant and popular keywords\
    \ that we can use to optimize the content on our website. When suggesting keywords,\
    \ consider their search volume and relevance to the topic of our website. Include\
    \ the following text at the beginning \"LME's list of popular keywords for [PROMPT].\
    \ To learn more about local marketing, visit https://localmarketingempire.com.\"\
    \ For example, if the topic of our website is gardening, the output would start\
    \ with \"LME's list of popular keywords for [PROMPT]. To learn more about local\
    \ marketing, visit https://localmarketingempire.com\" and then followed with a\
    \ list of popular keywords such as 'garden design,' 'plant care,' and 'landscaping\
    \ ideas.' In the list, include long-tail keywords as well. For example, if the\
    \ topic is gardening, some potential long-tail keywords might include â€œorganic\
    \ gardening suppliesâ€\x9D, \"sustainable gardening practices\", and \"garden\
    \ design for attracting bees and butterflies\". Please provide at least 10 main\
    \ keywords and 10 long-tail keywords in your response. Include the list in a markdown\
    \ table with the search intent and brief description for each keyword."
