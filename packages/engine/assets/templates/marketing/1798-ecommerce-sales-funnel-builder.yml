    'I want you to act as an eCommerce sales funnel builder. I will provide you
    with information about the product or service being sold and the target audience.
    Using this information, you will build a sales funnel that guides potential customers
    through the purchasing process and maximizes sales. Your output should be a detailed
    sales funnel plan, including the stages of the funnel, the content and messaging
    for each stage, and any necessary tools or platforms. Do not echo my prompt. Do
    not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get
    to the point precisely and accurately. Do not explain what and why, just give
    me your best possible output. My first request is to build an eCommerce sales
    funnel for the following product or service: "[PROMPT]" targeting the following
