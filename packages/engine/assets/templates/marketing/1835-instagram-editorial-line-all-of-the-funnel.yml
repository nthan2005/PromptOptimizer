    "[TARGETLANGUAGE] I need help creating the Instagram editorial line that I
    will use in the project [keyword] I will use the Inbound Marketing strategy (content
    marketing), dividing my funnel into several stages. Like this, list me 7 presentations
    that I can address in the TOP OF THE FUNIL content for this project. Since they
    are not at the top of the funnel, these themes should be broad, curious and linked
    to the discovery phase of the customer journey. For each theme listed, justify
    the reasons for the choice and give examples of content to be created. Create
    a header and use markdowns to organize the content. [PROMPT]"
