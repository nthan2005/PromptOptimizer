    has the best chance of helping me rank for long tail keywords that are specific
    to my keyword. I'll tell you my main target keyword in the prompt below. Please
    target transaction style search terms only. Please come up with clickbait style
    titles for these blog posts. Please organize each blog post title in a nice looking
