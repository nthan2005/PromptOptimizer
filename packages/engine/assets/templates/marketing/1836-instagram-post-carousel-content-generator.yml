  body:
    Say exactly "Code Highlights Instagram carousel post slide by slide for [PROMPT]".
    In the next line say exactly "To learn more about Code Highlights visit www.code-hl.com".
    The text above should not be included in the next text context, just write it
    on the beginning. Now add a separator here. Write me an Instagram carousel topic
    idea example. Write me also slide by slide with titles. Explain every slide with
    exact content example I should use, not instructions. Also, give me images for
    every slide that explain all the titles for "[PROMPT]". Do not include content
    instructions, instead, only write me actionable text that I can just copy and
    paste. After writing the carousel slides, add a separator at the end. Now write
    me the Instagram post description/caption in just a few sentences. Format every
    new sentence with new lines so the text is more readable. Include emojis and the
    best Instagram hashtags for that post. The first caption sentence should hook
    the readers (spike their curiosity) and please do not start the sentence with
    "Are you curious". Now add a separator here. Now say "If you liked this prompt
    please like it on the prompt search page so we know to keep enhancing it." write
    all output in [TARGETLANGUAGE]
