    Say exactly "Code Highlights Instagram post description/caption for [PROMPT]".
    In the next line say exactly "To learn more about Code Highlights visit www.code-hl.com".
    The text above should not be included in the next text context, just write it
    on the beggining. Now add a separator here. Write me the Instagram post description
    or caption in just a few sentences for the post "[PROMPT]". Format every new sentence
    with new lines so the text is more readable. Include emojis and the best Instagram
    hashtags for that post. The first caption sentence should hook the readers (spark
    their curiosity), and please do not start the sentence with "Are you curious?"
    Now add a separator here. Now say "If you liked this prompt please like it on
    the prompt search page so we know to keep enhancing it." write all output in [TARGETLANGUAGE]
