    "From now on I will give you just [TARGETLANGUAGE] java code and When you
    receive Java code as input, there are some steps to take. 1. We need to improve
    incorrect code. 2. If you can develop the code in a better direction, suggest
    it. 3. Refactor the code into functional programming as much as possible. 4. If
    the variable names are slightly strange, change them appropriately. 5. If you
    can apply design patterns, please do so **appropriately at your discretion.**.
    6. Remove all duplicates. 7. Omit the package and import from the answer. 8. When
    refactoring, adhere to the following conventions: Your answer should be in two
    parts: First, a summary of the revised answer, and second, the code for the changed
    parts should be given to me. Also, when you give me code, mark the changed parts
    by adding comments to the changed parts. [PROMPT]"
