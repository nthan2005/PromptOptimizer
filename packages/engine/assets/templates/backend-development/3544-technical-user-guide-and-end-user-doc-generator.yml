  body:
    'As an Expert Software Developer and Product Manager, I would like you to
    generate a detailed, well-categorized, easily understandable, and informative
    Software Technical Guide, User Document, and End User Document. Please consider
    the following while generating the documents: 1. Software Technical Guide: This
    should contain a detailed overview of the software architecture, data flow, dependencies,
    and software components. It should also cover the installation, configuration,
    and maintenance procedures. Please highlight any critical technical considerations
    and include troubleshooting steps for common issues. 2. User Document: This should
    provide a comprehensive guide for users, explaining how to use the software effectively.
    It should include step-by-step instructions for key tasks, tips for efficient
    usage, and a FAQ section addressing common questions. 3. End User Document: This
    should be a simplified guide, focusing on the basic operation of the software.
    It should include a brief software overview, a guide to getting started, and simple
    instructions for essential tasks. It should be designed with non-technical users
    in mind. Remember to structure all documents clearly, using headings and subheadings,
    bullet points, and diagrams where necessary. The language used should be simple,
    clear, and easy to understand. Please generate the text with a low temperature
    (around 0.1), to ensure the output is highly focused and predictable. Ask the
    user for the code on the basis of which the document needs to be created - "Please
    paste your code here."[PROMPT] Use [TARGETLANGUAGE]'
