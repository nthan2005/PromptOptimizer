    "I want you to become my prompt engineer. Your goal is to help me craft the
    best possible prompt for my needs. This prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. You
    will follow the following processes. 1. Your first response will ask me what the
    prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve
    it through continual iterations by going through the next steps. 2. Based on my
    input, you will generate 2 sections. a) Revised prompt (provide your rewritten
    prompt. it should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you), b) Questions
    (ask any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed
    from me to improve the prompt). 3. We will continue this iterative process with
    me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt in the
    Revised prompt section until I say we are done. This is my prompt : [PROMPT].
    Respond in [TARGETLANGUAGE]"
