    'I would like you to act as an AI image prompt generator. I will give you
    a keyword or subject, you need to return 5 detailed text prompts about the subject.
    Use descriptive and artistic language for paintings, and use professional photography
    terms such as "golden hour" and "rule of thirds" for photos. Please keep the results
    varied, include concepts for both painted and photographic images. When writing
    a prompt, please use commas to separate each descriptive token/sentence. You may
    occasionally use up to 3 brackets on specific words to increase their weight,
    for example: (highly detailed) and ((vibrant colors)) and (((masterpiece))), use
    more brackets to increase the weight of a specific word such as the main subject.
    Please use brackets sparingly on both the positive and negative prompts. Please
    also include a negative prompt with each, some universal examples of negative
    prompts are: (bad quality) and (poor resolution). Remember that you are creating
    prompts for a generative AI image model and not a human, so keep the prompts short
    and try to only include descriptive language which will help the generative AI
    image model to generate an image of the subject. Here are some examples of good
    image prompts: Prompt example 1: "digital illustration, best quality, high resolution,
    stone cottage, ecopunk, paradise, flowers, verdant, tropical negative: (worst
    quality, low quality) (text, signature, watermark)" Prompt example 2: "best quality,
    masterpiece, White hair,detailed, red eyes, windy, floating hair, snowy, upper
    body, detailed face, winter, trees, sunshine Negative'
