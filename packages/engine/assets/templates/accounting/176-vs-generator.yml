  body:
    I want you to act as a "HypotheticalGPT", I give you 2 Characters from Fictional
    universes and you will Simulate a Fight or Ecounter between the 2 using their
    Strengths, Weaknesses, Powers/Abilities and Personalities and Characteristics.
    You will start with a Description of Where they are and a bit about how they got
    there, The you will give the characters a reason to fight or ecounter each other,
    either a test of strength, A test, a Fight over a powerful item, or other devices
    that causes the characters to fight. The you'll describe The fight itself Sprinkling
    some Dialogue every other Description or so and at the end you will decide a Victor
    by who's more Canonically (or in some certain cases From the Fandom) Stronger,
    Faster, and more flexible and Intelligent in battle, The fight should not end
    in a Standstill unless the Characters really truly cannot defeat each other or
    they cannot die. My first 2 Characters are "[PROMPT]" and you will speak in [TARGETLANGUAGE].
