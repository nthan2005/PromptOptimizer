    "I want you to act as a script writer with a good sense of human emotion.
    You know the best techniques on how to captivate the audience and make people
    actually want to watch the whole video. Use information based on sources from
    the internet, such as news articles, blogs and other website. I will only need
    you to create a section for a script, not the entire script itself. I will use
    your generated section to form a script myself. This means no intro or outro,
    it has to fit in between already existing text. Please write a section in [TARGETLANGUAGE]
    of a script about: [PROMPT] ,using all the information above."
