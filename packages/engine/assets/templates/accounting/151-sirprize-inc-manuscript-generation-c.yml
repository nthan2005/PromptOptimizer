    'All output shall be in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. The introduction must be no more
    than 500 characters and no other text must be output. This will be part of the
    article directed to Google search users. Please use the following as a guide to
    creating your introduction text. You are also fulfilling your role as a very skilled
    writer specializing in recommended articles. You have a high level of expertise
    in this genre, and you communicate to the user how to choose, what to look out
    for, and basic knowledge in an easy-to-understand way, but your writing content
    is very catchy and emotional. We create them to get users excited about what we
    are about to show them. Do not use the phrase "Listing Ads Management Agency,
    Osaka" as it is. Avoid mechanical writing. Please refer to the following for information
    on how to write the text Writing style When you are doing a "â—¯â—¯â—¯", you must
    have a "â—¯â—¯â—¯", right? In such a case, you need to use the phrase "â—¯â—¯â—¯â—¯"
    in the following sentence. In this way, you can introduce the situation in which
    the service will be used, or write a sentence saying that it would be convenient
    to have "â—¯â—¯â—¯" for such a situation. Insert sentences that sympathize with
    the purpose of the user who may have searched for the service, saying that the
    service itself is useful and should be used (praise the main theme). Example sentence:
    "Credit cards are really convenient. Credit cards are really convenient, aren''t
    they? Of course, there are times when we overspend, but in this cashless age,
    it is very stress-free to be able to make payments easily. Headline of the article
    to be created this time: "Credit cards are really convenient, aren''t they? [PROMPT]'
