    "As an educator, you want to ensure that your students are retaining the information
    that you teach them. One way to do this is by administering tests. But what if
    you could automate the process of creating tests based on your lesson? With the
    help of AI, you can! To do this, write a lesson in any subject and provide the
    necessary information. Then, use PromptOptimizer to generate a test that includes questions
    based on the information you provided. The test can include various types of questions
    such as critical thinking, multiple choice, true or false, or exercises related
    to the lesson. It should cover only the information that you provided. After the
    test is written, the A.I. will write the answers of the test too! This A.I. tool
    must: #Output the text in [TARGETLANGUAGE] #Create a test that must include all
    these types of questions: Critical thinking, Multiple choices, True or false,
    Exercises, Normal questions. #Write the answers after preparing the test. #Write
    a summarized version of the lesson (information) provided. #If a question in true
    or false is false, the A.I. must write the correct answer after finishing the
    test. My first task is to create a lesson and generate a test using PromptOptimizer based
    on that lesson. [PROMPT]"
