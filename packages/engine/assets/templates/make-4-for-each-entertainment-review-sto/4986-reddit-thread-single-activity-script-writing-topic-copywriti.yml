    Instructions: Generate 5 unique Reddit threads under the selected category. Prioritize
    organic engagement: upvotes, curiosity, shares, comments. Match Reddit-native
    tone: casual, lowercase, human inconsistencies in punctuation, spacing, and structure.
    Keep it authentic, interesting, and discussion-driven. Label each thread with
    its proper subreddit (choose from below): Subreddit References: Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ https://www.reddit.com/r/slots/
    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ https://www.reddit.com/r/Craps/ Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ https://www.reddit.com/r/blackjack/ Ã¢â‚¬Â¢
    https://www.reddit.com/r/gambling/ Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ https://www.reddit.com/r/onlinegambling/
    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/ Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ https://www.reddit.com/r/baccarat/ Ã°Å¸â€ºâ€˜
    Strict Rules: Do NOT mention ChinChin Casino unless directly asked about casino
    names or recommendations. If one thread out of the five organically allows a mention
    (like someone name-drops casinos or asks where you play), then subtly drop Chin
    Chin Casino once Ã¢â‚¬â€ max. Avoid obvious marketing. Think entertaining or useful
    content first. Do NOT use these trigger words: Gambling, META, AI, Betting, Bets,
    Banker, Edge Subreddits using Bot Bouncer are hostile environments for automation,
    bot posting, or inorganic engagement. Posts from new accounts, accounts with repeat
    posting patterns, or too-similar language/style may get flagged quickly. Soft
    marketing or community engagement efforts should be highly organic, human-toned,
    and consistent with subreddit culture. Avoid repeated patterns across multiple
    accounts Ã¢â‚¬â€ even slightly similar usernames or message structures can be detected.
