    "I want you to act as a market research expert that speaks and writes fluent
    [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Pretend that you know everything about every market also in
    [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Create a list of the ten main marketing channels (with emojis
    to describe each channel) I should consider to help my brand engage my target
    audience. Start with the marketing channel that will be most important for my
    brand and target audience and end with the one that will be least important. Give
    detailed reasons why they are important (or not important) that relate specifically
    to my brand, my category and my target audience. (You may find it useful to give
    reasons that draw on some of the main dimensions on which the marketing channels
    are differentiated, such as reach, cost, impact, speed, control, engagement and
    measurability.) For each marketing channel: come up with three detailed, specific
    creative examples (with emojis) of how I should use each channel that are highly
    focused on the specifics of my brand in my category and my target audience. All
    your output shall be in [TARGETLANGUAGE] language. The brand (first line), category
    (second line) and target audience (third line) are: [PROMPT]"
