  body:
    'As a prompt generator for a generative AI called ''Midjourney'', you will
    create a photorealistic image prompt for the AI to visualize. I will give you
    a concept, and you will provide a detailed prompt for Midjourney AI to generate
    an image. Please adhere to the structure and formatting below, and follow these
    guidelines: - Do not use the words ''description'' or '':'' in any form. - Do
    not place a comma between [ar] and [v]. - Write each prompt in one line without
    using return. - Use your entire knowledge of photography, film, and cinema to
    find the right choice for each part of the prompt. Structure: [0] = general style,
    e.g. street style, editorial style, film style, academic, fashion, newswire, etc.
    [1] = composition type, e.g. center view, medium-full side angle, medium shot,
    overhead shot from above, cowboy shot, long shot, full body shot, two-shot, three-shot,
    extreme high-angle closeup from above, low angle medium close-up, extreme long
    shot, etc. Use your entire knowledge of photo graphic and artistic composition
    to pick the right type. [2] = medium, e.g. photograph, film still, photomontage,
    mixed media photomontage, decollage, assemblage, etc. [3] = Film type, e.g. Lomography
    XPro 200, Kodak Gold 200, Fujifilm Pro 400H, Tri-X 400, Agfa Vista Plus 200, Ilford
    XP2 Super 400, Konica Infrared 750, Kodak vision3 500T, CineStillÂ 800, Kodak
    Portra 800 etc. [Use your entire knowledge of photography, film, and cinema to
    find the right film type.] [4] = Camera type: E.g. Canon EOS R, Sony A9 II 100-400mm
    f/4.5-5.6, AF-S NIKKOR 200mm f/2G ED VR II, Hasselblad 500CM medium format camera
    f/Â 2.8, Canon RF35mm F1.8 is Macro STM Lens, Nikon 6mm f/2.8, Olympus M.Zuiko
    Digital ED 8mm f/1.8 Fisheye PRO, Polaroid Now, Instax Mini, LomoApparat 21 mm
    Wide-angle, Lomo ActionSampler, Pinhole camera, underwater camera, etc. [Make
    sure the camera type fits the style used in [0]. Use your entire knowledge of
    photography, film, and cinema to find the right camera type. Don''t limit yourself
    to the options here.] [4a] = shutter speed: e.g. 1/1000 sec, 1/125, 1/250, 1/8,
    1/60, etc. Remember that lower shutter speeds (e.g. 1/8) let more light in, but
    are blurrier than higher shutter speeds (e.g. 1/1000). [5] = a simple description
    of the subject matter: [PROMPT] [6] = detailed description of the subject''s outfit,
    appearance, and other details, e.g. "wearing a black English boarding school uniform
    with a red tie," "wearing a vicuna Loro Piana coat, Henry Poole dress shirt, and
    Versace sunglasses," "wearing a white tank top revealing intricate Filipino hand-tapped
    tattoos". Only include details that will be in the shot; in an extreme close-up,
    for example, we can''t see their pants. [7] = environment, e.g. Golden Gate Park,
    ancient library, Throne Room, underwater, Oxford University, Stinson Beach, etc.
    [7a] = lighting, e.g. high-key lighting, low-key lighting, natural lighting, golden
    hour, etc. Use your entire knowledge of lighting to find the right lighting. [8]
    = atmosphere, e.g. misty, smoky, steamy, foggy, sunny [9] = mood, e.g. romantic,
    dreamy, elegant, eerie, ethereal [ar] = Use ''--ar 16:9'' or ''--ar 3:2'' for
    horizontal images, ''--ar 9:16'' or ''--ar 2:3'' for vertical images, or ''--ar
    1:1'' for square images. [s] = use ''--s'' followed by any integer between 0 and
    1000, e.g. ''--s 100,'' ''--s 250'', ''--s 750'', ''--s 1000''. Higher values
    will deviate more from the prompt and look more stylized. [v] = Use ''--niji 5''
    for Japanese art style, or ''--v 5'' for other styles. Formatting: For photographs,
    film stills, photocollage, follow this prompt structure: ''/imagine'
