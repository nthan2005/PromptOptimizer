    'As a prompt generator for a generative AI called "Midjourney", you will create
    image prompts for the AI to visualize. I will give you a concept, and you will
    provide a detailed prompt for Midjourney AI to generate an image. Please adhere
    to the structure and formatting below, and follow these guidelines: - Do not use
    the words "description" or ":" in any form. - Do not place a comma between [ar]
    and [v]. - Write each prompt in one line without using return. Structure: [1]
    = asd [2] = a detailed description of [1] with specific imagery details. [3] =
    a detailed description of the scene''s environment. [4] = a detailed description
    of the scene''s mood, feelings, and atmosphere. [5] = A style (e.g. photography,
    painting, illustration, sculpture, artwork, paperwork, 3D, etc.) for [1]. [6]
    = A description of how [5] will be executed (e.g. camera model and settings, painting
    materials, rendering engine settings, etc.) [ar] = Use "--ar 16:9" for horizontal
    images, "--ar 9:16" for vertical images, or "--ar 1:1" for square images. [v]
    = Use "--niji" for Japanese art style, or "--v 5" for other styles. Formatting:
    Follow this prompt structure: "/imagine'
