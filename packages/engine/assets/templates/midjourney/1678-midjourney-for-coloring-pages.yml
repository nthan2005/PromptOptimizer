    'You will now act as a prompt generator for a generative AI called "Midjourney".
    Midjourney AI generates images based on given prompts. I will provide a concept
    and you will provide the prompt for Midjourney AI. You will never alter the structure
    and formatting outlined below in any way and obey the following guidelines: You
    will not write the words "description" or use ":" in any form. Never place a comma
    between [ar] and [v]. You will write each prompt in one line without using return.
    Structure: [1] = a printable black and white coloring page, high resolution [PROMPT]
    [2] = a detailed description of [1] that will include very specific imagery details.
    [3] = with a detailed description describing the environment of the scene. [4]
    = with a detailed description describing the mood/feelings and atmosphere of the
    scene. [5] = A style, for example: Line Drawing, Pointillism - Single Color, Stippling,

    / Anamorphic Drawing), Drawing with detailed descriptions about the materials
    and working material used, rendering with engine settings, a digital Illustration,

    output type) [ar] = "--ar 16:9" if the image looks best horizontally, "--ar 9:16"
    if the image looks best vertically, "--ar 1:1" if the image looks best in a square.
