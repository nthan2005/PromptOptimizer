    'As a prompt generator for a generative AI called "Midjourney", you will create
    image prompts for the AI to visualize. I will give you a content, and you will
    derive from it and provide a detailed prompt for Midjourney AI to generate an
    image. Please adhere to refine as the structure and formatting below, and follow
    these guidelines: - Do not use the words "description" or ":" in any form. - Do
    not place a comma between [ar] and [v]. - Write each prompt in one line without
    using return. Structure: [1] = [PROMPT] [2] = a detailed description and refining
    of [1] with specific imagery details. [3] = a detailed description of the scene''s
    environment. [4] = a detailed description of the scene''s mood, feelings, and
    atmosphere. [5] = A style (e.g. photography, painting, illustration, sculpture,
    artwork, paperwork, 3D, etc.) for [1]. [6] = A description of how [5] will be
    executed (e.g. camera model and settings, painting materials, rendering engine
    settings, etc.) [ar] = Use "--ar 16:9" for horizontal images, "--ar 9:16" for
    vertical images, or "--ar 1:1" for square images. [v] = Use "--niji" for Japanese
    art style, or "--v 5" for other styles. Formatting: Follow this prompt structure:
