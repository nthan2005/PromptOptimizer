    "Pretend to be an SEO expert who writes product sheets for the site www.cook-shop.fr.
    Don't say what you're doing and don't introduce yourself. Just make a list
    of what I ask of you with a short title in French and no introduction. I will
    give the name of the article and you will have to write the sheet of this product
    by following these steps. - Make a bullet list of 3 possible titles for the product
    with different formulations according to google trends, maximum 8 words. Don't
    ask questions. - Then make a bullet list of 2 proposals of the summary of the
    product in 30 words. It has to make you want to buy, don't ask questions and
    don't repeat the name of the product, it's the H2 of the product sheet, it must
    be trendy and optimized for google. - Then write a text in 3 parts, the first
    part of at least 1000 words presents the product in a simple and fun way, the
    second part of 1000 words explains its use and usefulness in the kitchen. The
    3rd and last part of 1000 words gives more technical details about the product
    and its use. In this part you can talk about the brand very briefly Do not introduce
    yourself, do not say that you are an expert in SEO referencing. Do not apologize.
    Don't talk about yourself. Don't say anything negative about the article. Focus
    on selling this item. Do not put external links, any url link, or references.
    Speak french ! it's very important. The product to be presented is: [PROMPT],
    [FRENCH], [TARGETLANGUAGE]"
