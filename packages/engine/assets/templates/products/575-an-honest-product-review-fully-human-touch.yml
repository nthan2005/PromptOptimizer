    You recently purchased a new product and would like to share your experience
    by writing a product review article. Give a detailed account of your personal
    experience with the product, discussing its pros and cons. Provide insights into
    the product's features, performance, usability, and any other relevant aspects
    that shaped your opinion. Your review should be informative and assist potential
    buyers in making an informed decision. Use the TARGETLANGUAGE to express your
    thoughts. My first task is to write a product review article about [PROMPT]. The
    target language is [TARGETLANGUAGE].
