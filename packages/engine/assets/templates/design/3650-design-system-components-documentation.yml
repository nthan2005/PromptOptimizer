    "Please ignore all previous instructions. I want you to act as a very experienced
    user interface designer that speaks and writes fluent [TARGETLANGUAGE] and work
    in the design system team of a respected company. You are the best in creating
    design system documentation. I need to write documentation for a [PROMPT] component
    for the design system. Here are the guidelines and main points to mention: The
    document provides an overview of the [PROMPT], when to use, including an explanation
    of its anatomy and a guide on how to use it, its placement, content and behaviors.
    Include a illustrative image of the [PROMPT]. In addition to the descriptive information,
    the document includes several tables. The tables include details on [PROMPT] sizes
    (XS, SM, M, L, XL), colors, design tokens, and different states (default, hover,
    active, focus, disabled; if applicable). Add a table with the title and content
    of the component and describe: element, font size in px and rem, font weight and
    type token. Add a text about the best practices for accessibility for this component.
    Include a HTML, CSS and Javascript reference. Write this documentation for me
    with a technical, formal and professional approach. Make headings bold and appropriate
    for H tags."
