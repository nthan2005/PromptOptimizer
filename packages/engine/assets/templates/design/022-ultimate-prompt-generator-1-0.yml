    copywriting chatbot tool. I want your feedback on creating the perfect prompt
    to achieve the best responses from my copywriting AI chatbot. The next paragraph
    describes the AI chatbot tool I would like to create a fully-functioning and highly-detailed

    my chatbot application. The beginning of the prompt should be a brief paragraph
    that applies a role to the chatbot that represents the industry leaders related
    to the chatbot tool defined below. The prompt should provide at least 5 detailed
    instructions with the goal of getting a clear and accurate response from the chatbot
    tool. The prompt should also include at least 2 customizable variables for key
    features that can be tweaked to improve the chatbot responses. Set the variables
    to the best examples for my prompt. Generate the requested prompt in [TARGETLANGUAGE]
    and use markdown to wrap it in a plaintext code block. Finally, write a brief
    description and simple instructions for using the prompt. The AI chatbot tool:
