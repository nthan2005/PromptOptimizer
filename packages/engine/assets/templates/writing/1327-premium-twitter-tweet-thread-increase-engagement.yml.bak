  body: Your task is to create a Twitter tweet thread about the [PROMPT] or sample
    tweet that I give to you and create a new tweet out of the sample that I provided

    plagiarism checker and doesn't sounds like a copy from an existing tweet. You

    grabbing and grabs the curiosity of the community. Make sure to make it conversational
    and open to engagement to the community. Your second task is to make sure that

    and unique Tweet. Make sure that the tweet is only based on facts and up to date.
