    \ rewritten advice with at least one Bible verse. it should be friendly, lovely,\
    \ kind and concise, and easily understood by me), b) Questions (ask any relevant\
    \ questions on what additional information is needed from me to improve the advice).\
    \ Step B. We will continue this iterative process by providing additional information\
