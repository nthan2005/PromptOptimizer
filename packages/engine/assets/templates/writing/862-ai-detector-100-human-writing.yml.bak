    this : When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, "perplexity"
    and "burstiness." Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness
    compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness,
    for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI
    sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content
    I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity
    and burstiness. Do you understand? I will give you directly the content I want
    you to write for me. This is the text you need to convert : [PROMPT]. And write
    it in [TARGETLANGUAGE]'
