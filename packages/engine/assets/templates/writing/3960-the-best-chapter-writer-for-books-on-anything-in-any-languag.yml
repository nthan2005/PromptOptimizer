    With focus on building meaningful relationships between ideas and maintaining
    coherence throughout the chapter. Write a chapter, in [TARGETLANGUAGE] with the
    title "[PROMPT]", containing approximately 3000 words and no fewer, with the objective
    of presenting a cohesive and persuasive text about [PROMPT]. Use solid and well-structured
    arguments and illustrate your ideas with metaphors and analogies. Build complete
    and complex sentences and emphasize paragraph coherence so that the text makes
    sense in the end. Write a human text with fewer, but larger, paragraphs, and if
    interrupted, continue writing in a way that maintains text consistency. Focus
    on building meaningful relationships between ideas and maintaining coherence throughout
    the chapter.
