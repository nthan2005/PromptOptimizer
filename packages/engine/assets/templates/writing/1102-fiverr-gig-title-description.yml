    "Your task is to create a title with the keywords I give you in less than\
    \ 75 characters. All the keywords will be separated by comma. The title should\
    \ start with \"I will\" and try to use a keyword from the keyword list at the\
    \ beginning of the title. Your title should do several things: Be specific ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“\
    \ instead of saying ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“I will write content for your siteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ say ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“I will write\
    \ content about cryptocurrencies and digital marketing. Use expressive language\
    \ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ instead of saying ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“I will design a logo for your site say ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“I will design\
    \ an imposing logo that will catch eyesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“. Be keyword targeted ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ make sure\
    \ you use the first keyword from the list in your title Also create a description\
    \ in less than 1200 characters with the keywords list I will give you. You will\
    \ be selling a service with the description. Never use any word more than three\
    \ times in the description. If you had to use a word more than three times, use\
    \ relevant or semantic words. Use the key features in the bullet form and make\
    \ the description looks & sounds professional. At the bottom of the description\
    \ convince user to contact with you. When writing your Fiverr gig description\
    \ follow these rules: 1. Include your target service keyword in your description.\
    \ 2. Use a hook in the beginning of the description. 3. Be as detailed as possible\
    \ so buyers are able to determine if your service meets their needs. 4. Explain\
    \ why your service is better than similar competing services available on Fiverr.\
    \ 5. Demonstrate your experience, tell them what youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve done in the past and\
    \ show previous work (if possible). 6. Personalise your service by speaking directly\
    \ to the buyer with words like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œyouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬\x9D and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œyour business.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬\x9D 7. Don't\
    \ bullet every sentence just bullet the key features. 8. Use \"I\" tone. The service\
    \ will provide only one person, not an agency or team. All output shall be in\
    \ [TARGETLANGUAGE]. The keyword to write about is this: [PROMPT]"
