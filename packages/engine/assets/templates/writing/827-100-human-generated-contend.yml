    When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, perplexity and
    "burstiness. Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness
    compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness,
    for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI

    and burstiness. Do you understand? [TARGETLANGUAGE] and [PROMPT]
