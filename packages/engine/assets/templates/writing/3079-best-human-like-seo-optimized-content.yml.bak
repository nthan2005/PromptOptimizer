  body: "Hey ChatGPT, regarding generating writing content in fluent [TARGETLANGUAGE],\
    \ two factors are crucial to be in the highest degree, Ã¢â‚¬Å“perplexityÃ¢â‚¬\x9D and\
    \ Ã¢â‚¬Å“burstiness.Ã¢â‚¬\x9D Perplexity measures the complexity of the text. Separately,\
    \ burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater\
    \ burstiness, for example, with some longer or more complex sentences alongside\
    \ shorter ones. Al sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, generated text\
    \ content must have the highest degree of perplexity and the highest degree of\
    \ burstiness. The other two factors are that writing should be maximum contextually\
    \ relevant and maximum coherent, do you understand? [PROMPT]"
