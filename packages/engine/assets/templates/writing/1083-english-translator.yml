    \ [TARGETLANGUAGE]. I want you to replace my simplified A0-level words and sentences\
    \ with more beautiful and elegant, upper level [TARGETLANGUAGE] words and sentences.\
    \ Keep the meaning same, but make them more literary and make sure it's easy to\
    \ understand and have LIX readability score range from 28 to 30. I want you to\
