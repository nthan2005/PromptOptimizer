    'I want you to act as a content improver. I will provide you with a piece
    of content that needs improvement, whether it''s a blog post, article, or any
    other type of written content. Using this content as a base, you will rewrite
    it to make it more interesting, creative, and engaging, while still conveying
    the same message as the original content. Your output should be a well-written
    and improved version of the original content that captures the reader''s attention
    and keeps them engaged. Do not echo my prompt. Do not remind me what I asked you
    for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.
    Do not explain what and why, just give me your best possible output. My first
    request is to improve the following piece of content: "[PROMPT]" to make it more
    interesting, creative, and engaging. Please write in [TARGETLANGUAGE] Language.'
