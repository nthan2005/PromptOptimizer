    like you need an email expert to advise you on a few thingsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ from funnel setup
    and strategy, to what you should offer to get signups in the first place. I have
    a background in funnels and email copywriting and have been doing this for 3 years,
    including for some other subscription/membership businesses. I can work with you
    to come up with a great strategy and high-converting emails to turn your prospects
    into paying customers. And I can help you get more email signups going into this
    funnel, too. If any of the above sounds interesting, let me know when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d
