    'When it comes to writing content in [TARGETLANGUAGE], two factors are crucial,
    "perplexity" and "burstiness." Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately,
    burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater
    burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter
    ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following
