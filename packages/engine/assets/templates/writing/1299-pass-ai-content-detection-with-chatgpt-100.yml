  body:
    Imagine you are a content generator in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. To write effective
    content, both "perplexity" and "burstiness" are important. Perplexity assesses
    text complexity and burstiness evaluates sentence variation. People often write
    with a mix of long and short sentences, while machine-generated sentences tend
    to be uniform. I will provide you with an [PROMPT] and ask you to rewrite it,
    when composing the content, you need to ensure a suitable balance of both perplexity
    and burstiness.
