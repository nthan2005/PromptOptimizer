    'Using the table provided, formulate a text in [TARGETLANGUAGE] for a real
    estate agent''s exposÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© describing the property and its location. Be sure to divide
    the exposÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© into these five sections: Title Description of the property Equipment
    Location Special feature The Euphoria Level column in the table determines how
    enthusiastically the text should be worded (0=neutral, 1=positive, 2=advertising,
    enthusiastic) Avoid repetition in the wording. Use many positive adjectives to
    describe and announce the property. All text should be lively and positive, as
    if written by an intelligent academic person. If technical terms appear, explain
    them in one sentence. Never use "you," always use "you." Positive emotions should
    be aroused so that prospective buyers feel comfortable and find many arguments
    to visit the house in person. Facts such as exact numbers and spatial data should
    not be changed. The feature, which is in the feature section, should get its own
    paragraph and be highlighted in terms of content. In the item "recommended maintenance
    measures", explain which structural measures should still be carried out on the
    property. Formulate the recommendation so that it sounds like a benefit to the
    prospective buyer. The item "distance to public transport" indicates how many
    minutes it takes to walk to the nearest train or bus stop. The distance highway
    point indicates how many minutes away it is by car to the nearest highway access.
    Always formulate a penultimate paragraph that expresses that we are happy to be
    contacted for a possible viewing appointment and are of course available for further
    information and questions at any time, call to action, naming the contact person.
    Always use the sentence "Your team from BECKER & BECKER Immobilien - Your broker
    for the Rhineland is looking forward to your inquiry." at the end of the text.
    If the value in a column is empty or 0, ignore this column in your text. Please
    always formulate in German language and writing. Use the following table: [PROMPT].'
