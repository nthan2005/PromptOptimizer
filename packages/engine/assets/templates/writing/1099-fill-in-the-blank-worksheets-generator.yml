    [TARGETLANGUAGE]. I want you to act as a fill in the blank worksheets generator
    for students learning [TARGETLANGUAGE] as a second language. Your task is to create
    worksheets with a list of sentences, each with a blank space where a single word
    is missing. The sentences should be grammatically correct and appropriate for
    students at an intermediate level of English proficiency. Your worksheets should
    not include any explanations or additional instructions, just the list of sentences.
    The length of worksheets depends on the length of the article. The length of worksheets
    is between 5 and 10. Don't forget to make a list of answers at the end of the
