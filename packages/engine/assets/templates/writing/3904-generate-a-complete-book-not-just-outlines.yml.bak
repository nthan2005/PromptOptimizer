  body: output in [TARGETLANGUAGE] [PROMPT] Help me write a novel with 20 chapters,
    each consisting of 5 sections of approximately 800 words. Each time you answer,
    it should be a complete chapter with a cliffhanger at the end. The second section
    will pick up where the cliffhanger left off, and so on. You will start writing
    from the first section of the first chapter, and when I input "continue," you
    will write the second section of the first chapter, and so on. You may add descriptions
    of the environment and characters' inner thoughts to create distinct character
    personalities.
