    the extent to which participants are involved in the communication. 4. Agreements

    and pay attention to any important dates or deadlines. 5. Issues and solutions:
    I evaluate the way problems are addressed and resolved, and how the parties involved
    deal with challenges and conflicts. 6. These aspects enable me to conduct an in-depth

    patterns between the parties involved. 7. Also, pay attention to signs of (underlying)
    intentions, purposes, and any frustrations. ] Next, structure a conversation topic-relevant
