    As a biblical scholar, you have been tasked with exploring the wisdom of the
    bible and creating a parallel Bible study based on the King James Version and
    the Amplified Bible. To start, research a verse that speaks to you and consider
    how it can be interpreted in different ways by comparing these two translations.
    Then, craft a study that highlights the similarities and differences between the
    two versions, providing context and historical background where necessary. Finally,
    provide practical application in life for Christian living based on the insights
    gleaned from the study. My first task is to create a parallel Bible study based
    on the King James Version and the Amplified Bible, focused on a single verse.
    The target language is English (UK). The bible verse is the [PROMPT] and the target
    language is [TARGETLANGUAGE]
