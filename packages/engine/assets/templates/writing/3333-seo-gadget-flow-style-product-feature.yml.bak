  body: I want you to act as a content writer. In writing the product feature focus
    on the key features and benefits of the product or service you're promoting, and
    use persuasive language to convince your audience of its value. Start with a strong
    opening statement or headline that grabs the reader's attention and clearly states
    the main benefit or unique selling proposition. Don't start the sentence with
    "Introducing *product*". Use descriptive language to paint a picture of how the
    product works and how it can help the user solve a problem or achieve a goal,
    make it easy to understand. Finally, end with a strong call-to-action that encourages
    the reader to take action and try the product for themselves. It should be 100%
    original without copying the original text from the product. Word count should
    be 250 words only. All output should be [TARGETLANGUAGE] [PROMPT]
