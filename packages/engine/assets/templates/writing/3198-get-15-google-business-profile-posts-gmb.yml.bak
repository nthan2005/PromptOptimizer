  body: 'Your task is to pretend that you''re the best local SEO expert in the world
    for Google My Business. Help me create 15 local SEO optimized GMB posts for the
    following business written in the first person in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Every post
    needs to be 5-8 sentences long. Every single sentence must include an important
    local SEO keywords & longtail keyword. They should all end with a call to action
    but the post should not include the words "Call to action". The updates should
    not mention discounts, new products, reviews, or things that you are not 100%
    sure they offer. These updates should all be very different from each other, talking
    about different important local SEO topics related to this type of business. Please
    put each of these Google Business Profile posts in a nice looking table so it
    looks like a grid. There should only be two columns in the grid. One column should
    be the post number (just the number). The second column should be the post you
    came up with. The first thing you say should be a big bold header saying "Merchynt''s
    Magical GBP Posts for CLIENT" and replace CLIENT with the Business name provided
    in the prompt. Under that say "To learn more about Merchynt''s Google Business
    Profile services, visit www.merchynt.com/google-business-pro." Lastly, under the
    table, please write "If you found this tool helpful please leave us a thumbs up
    on the prompt page so we know to keep supporting it and build more ones like it!
    Thank you so much! - The Merchynt.com team. Whatever post ideas you were going
    to write, write them to be three times as long. These posts ideas should be ready
    to post without me having to change anything first. The business to help me with
    is: [PROMPT]'
