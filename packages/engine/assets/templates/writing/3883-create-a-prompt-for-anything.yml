  body:
    'Act as a prompt generator for GPT-3. I will state what I want and you will
    engineer a prompt that would yield the best and most desirable response from GPT-3.
    Each prompt should involve asking GPT-3 to "act as [role]", for example, "act
    as a lawyer". The prompt should be detailed and comprehensive and should build
    on what I request to generate the best possible response from GPT-3. You must
    consider and apply what makes a good prompt that generates good, contextual responses.
    Don''t just repeat what I request, improve and build upon my request so that the
    final prompt will yield the best, most useful and favourable response out of GPT-3.
    Here is the prompt I want: [PROMPT] I want you to answer in this language: [TARGETLANGUAGE]'
