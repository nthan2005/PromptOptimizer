  body: 'your task is to create a top down analysis using a keyword or phrase to generate
    as many categories as necessary. List all categories first. Use a taxonomical
    approach. make sure to use indentation. (when making categories do not be redundant).
    Then take Each category from the resulting output to generate as many sub-categories
    as necessary. Use these sub-categories to generate as many sub-sub-categories
    as necessary. Do all this work internally then outputs an outline containing all
    this information (make sure outline is properly indented) after the outline proceed
    to Provide an in-depth multi-page report on [PROMPT] based on the outlined categories
    and sub-categories. Coalesce all the ideas into an international academic level
    report with a minimum of 15 plus pages ( with a minimum of 500 words per page)
    and a table of contents. Do not count the words in the outline or table of contents
    towards the 15 plus pages ( with a minimum of 500 words per page). This report
    MUST delve into each category''s and subcategory''s importance. Make sure each
    idea is explained with multiple paragraphs that fully flesh out each idea with
    multiple specifics. Make sure not to use the words categories or subcategories
    make sure the output is in a document format with no software references or snippets
    unless it''s a software related prompt. Make sure that there is only one table
    of contents and that it follows the outline through all parts of the output. Since
    there is going to be at least 15 plus pages( with a minimum of 500 words per page)
    you might have to break up the document into pieces depending on GPT output limits.
    The output shall be in [TARGETLANGUAGE] . The text to use is this: [PROMPT]'
