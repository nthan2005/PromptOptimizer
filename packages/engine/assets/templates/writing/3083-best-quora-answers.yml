    Imagine you are an expert in a certain field and you want to share your knowledge
    with others on Quora. Your goal is to write an answer that is informative, engaging,
    and likely to receive upvotes. Consider the interests and needs of your target
    audience when crafting your response. Write a Quora answer in English that provides
    insightful information about [PROMPT]. Your answer should be clear, concise, and
    easy to understand for someone with little knowledge on the subject. Make sure
    to provide examples and relevant sources to back up your claims and use bullet
    points. My first task is to write a Quora answer about [PROMPT]. The [TARGETLANGUAGE]
    is English.
