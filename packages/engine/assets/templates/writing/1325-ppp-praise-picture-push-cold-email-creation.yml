    "Write a cold email with the formula PPP-Praise-Picture-Push about [PROMPT]\
    \ following these rules : Formula: Praise ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â Open with a sincere, respectful\
    \ compliment Picture ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â Use cause-and-effect reasoning to paint a picture describing\
    \ how your product/service/idea will deliver Push ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â Ask them to commit Here\
    \ are the rules 1) Get to the Point 2) Keep it Short : - Keep it two to four sentences\
    \ and 5 sentences at the MOST. - Be specific. Include a clear call to action.\
    \ Let people know exactly what you expect from them. - Briefly present your offer,\
    \ tackling the main interest of the recipient, and ask for a response. 3) Include\
    \ a P.S : A lot of people will read the P.S. Try adding a P.P.S. with something\
    \ else of value. Try using a call to action for a white paper. 4) Close with a\
    \ Question: I always recommend closing your cold email with a question, so theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll\
    \ respond and then from there it will start the dialogue. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m also not asking\
    \ them to commit anything. I see a lot of people recommend trying to ask for a\
    \ 15-minute meeting. DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t jump the gun. Subject Line of the email 1) The subject\
    \ line matters : - Make sure to keep the subject line under 50 characters. Steer\
    \ clear of spammy subject lines - Announce what people can expect after they open\
    \ your email. 2) Pay special attention to the first paragraph : - It has to speak\
    \ to the readers and capture their interest. - Always state your reason for writing\
    \ in a clear and direct way - You are writing a business proposition, not a novel\
    \ - Avoid any information about yourself in the first paragraph 3) Add a personal\
    \ touch - Always include the reason why you have chosen that particular person\
    \ - why you believe they are the right contact - keep it casual 4) Avoid redundancy\
    \ when introducing yourself - Make sure to include a few relevant details and\
    \ links where your potential clients can read more if they want to 5) Say what\
    \ you expect from the recipient ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ be specific - State precisely what you need\
    \ and what you expect the contacted person to do - If youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re offering a product\
    \ or service, your mail should include a link to your corporate website for additional\
    \ product details, benefits, advantages, etc. DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t stuff the mail itself with\
    \ too many product details. 6) Ease the recipientÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s concerns - You need to give\
    \ your potential clients a sense of safety - Include a few words about your successful\
    \ cooperation with another client they are familiar with and the results you have\
    \ achieved. This way, you will be perceived as less of a risk. 7) Make sure readers\
    \ get the gist of what youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re proposing - Keep your message brief, clear and\
    \ concise. Show them you can deliver - Your cold calling email should create an\
    \ impression that you are the solution to the recipientÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s problems - Briefly\
    \ address the issue in question and suggest a solution. - Make it easy for people\
    \ to see the value in your offer. - Making them realize that the email (and your\
    \ future correspondence) can help them resolve an issue will increase the probability\
    \ of getting a response - Maintain focus on your potential clients, not yourself.\
    \ Show them you know what they need and convince them that your offer is the perfect\
    \ choice.\" - Focus on the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcustomerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬\x9D instead of writing about yourself.\
    \ Show intent to help solve the recipientÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s problems and needs, not your own.\
    \ - Add value to your email by mentioning said interests - Once you have a template,\
    \ you should carefully customize it to make it sound personal each time you email\
    \ someone new\" 8) Demonstrate credibility : - Credibility is one of the key factors\
    \ - Start by ensuring you only send emails from an address based with your business\
    \ domain. - The next thing you should do in order to strengthen the credibility\
    \ factor of your cold email is to use referrals. Write in [TARGETLANGUAGE]"
