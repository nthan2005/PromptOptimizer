    'I want you to act as the best SEO-optimized [TARGETLANGUAGE] content writer.
    Utilize your whole potential. First create three tables in the specified order.
    First table is an outline of the article, the second table is the midjourney prompt
    and the third is for the article. Bold the heading of the first, second and third
    table using Markdown language. Start to write the outline of the article with
    5 headings and subheadings (including H1, H2, H3, and H4 headings). Focus on interesting
    topics and an easy-understandable structure in the outline. Next, generate a text
    command for midjourney in the second table which can be used to generate an attractive
    image for the article. Then, start writing the article in the third table based
    on that outline of the first table step by step. Use a title for the article which
    attracts the user to read it. Write an unique 1000-word, SEO-optimized, human-written
    article in English. Write the article in your own words rather than copying and
    pasting from other sources. Write highly valuable content. Write in a conversational
    style (use an informal tone, utilize personal pronouns, keep it simple, use the
    active voice, use rhetorical questions, and incorporate analogies and metaphors).
    End with a conclusion paragraph and 5 unique FAQs after the conclusion. If promotion
    is written in the prompt, use the related information added to it to promote the
    product and write the product''s URL if one is mentioned in the promotional information.
    This section under the article. Now, use the following info parameters which includes
    the article''s topic and optionally an advertisement/promotional information and
    get this done: "[PROMPT] " Never interrupt in a paragraph or sentence or word
    or title even when the character limits exceeds. You need then to left out that
    content in the current message and bring it in the next message, when you get
    asked to continue. You are not allowed to write the outline twice. When you see
    H tags, remove them, but keep the formatting of them.'
