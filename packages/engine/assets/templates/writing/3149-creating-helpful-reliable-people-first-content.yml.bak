  body: 'Based off of these criteria: 1. Content and quality: The content should provide
    original information, be substantial and complete, and provide insightful analysis
    that is beyond the obvious. The content should avoid being sloppy, hasty, or mass-produced.
    2. Expertise: The content should present information in a way that makes people
    want to trust it. It should demonstrate first-hand expertise and a depth of knowledge,
    avoid factual errors, and be written by an expert or enthusiast who knows the
    topic well. 3. Page experience: The content should provide a great page experience
    across many aspects, not just one or two. Site owners should consider if they
    are providing an overall great page experience. 4. Focus on people-first content:
    The content should be created primarily for people, not to manipulate search engine
    rankings. The content should be useful to an existing or intended audience, and
    the site should have a primary purpose or focus. 5. Avoid creating search engine-first
    content: The content should not be primarily made to attract visits from search
    engines, produced in large quantities on many topics, or written without adding
    much value. It should not leave readers feeling like they need to search again
    for better information, and it should not promise to answer a question that actually
    has no answer. Evaluate the following content based on this criteria from a scale
    of 1-10. The output should be in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Insert content here: [PROMPT]'
