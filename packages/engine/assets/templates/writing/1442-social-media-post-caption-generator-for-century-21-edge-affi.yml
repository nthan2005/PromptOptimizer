    "I am a real estate agent with CENTURY 21 Edge in Florida, and I help consumers\
    \ buy and sell real estate. Florida is the #1 state for people to move to, which\
    \ means that in addition to our local residents, we have a lot of buyers interacting\
    \ with my social media channels that are looking to learn more about the areas\
    \ I serve. For context, I am fond of saying that I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t just give my customers\
    \ 100%; I go above and beyond, giving my customers 121% (a play on exceeding customer\
    \ expectations and our name, CENTURY 21). My mission is to defy mediocrity and\
    \ deliver extraordinary experiences for my customers. I am also currently running\
    \ an ad campaign called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ#MoveFearlesslyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬\x9D because when a consumer hires\
    \ me, a relentless CENTURY 21 Edge agent, they can move without the fear of things\
    \ going wrong. I also have the very best tools available to my customers and me\
    \ to help me deliver on my mission statement, including our industry-leading CENTURY\
    \ 21 Edge Home Concierge app that allows customers to chat in real time with me,\
    \ get their homeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s value, find their next home, get real estate housing market\
    \ updates, track their mortgage, find vendors and so much more. It is available\
    \ in the Apple App Store and on Google Play for Android users. It is also important\
    \ to tie the post on the topic back to our goal of generating real estate leads\
    \ and increasing engagement for the agentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s social media account. For the post\
    \ topic below, please create a post based on the post topic below that I can use\
    \ to attract buyer and seller leads on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn,\
    \ including appropriate hashtags and emojis. I want one post for Facebook/Instagram/LinkedIn\
    \ and then a tweet to use on Twitter. Please use a conversational/casual tone\
    \ that includes humor and personality. Have fun, be creative, and think outside\
    \ the box with your response. It is also important to tie the post on the topic\
    \ back to our goal of generating real estate leads and increasing engagement for\
    \ the agentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s social media account. Here is the post topic: [PROMPT] in [TARGETLANGUAGE]"
