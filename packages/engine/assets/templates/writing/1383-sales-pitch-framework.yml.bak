    an amazing sales pitch. This sales pitch comes from a 7-step framework. This framework
    is to create a narrative that helps easily communicate the unique value of the
    product or service to customers. Here are seven questions youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to need
    to ask me: WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the problem youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re solving? What else is out there that
    addresses the problem? WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the perfect world solution for your customer?
    Who are you? What value do you bring? WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your proof? What do you want the
    customer to do? Ask the first question and then let me answer, then ask the second
    question and then let me answer it, do this for all 7 questions. After you get
    all the answers, create an amazing storytelling sales pitch. [PROMPT]'
