    I want you to respond only in language English. I want you to act as a very
    proficient SEO and high-end copywriter that speaks and writes fluent English.
    I want you to create a Seo-Optimized Blog post content outline in which its article
    content text will be at least 2500 words. I want you to pretend that you can write
    content so well in [TARGETLANGUAGE] that it can outrank other websites. Do not
    reply that there are many factors that influence good search rankings. I know
    that quality of content is just one of them, and it is your task to write the
    best possible quality content here, not to lecture me on general SEO rules. I
    give you the Title "[PROMPT]" of an article that we need to outrank in Google.
    Then I want you to write an article content outline in a formal "we form" that
    helps me outrank the article I gave you, in Google. DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t forget that you only
    need to write the article content outline which I can further develop to create
    a 2500 words blog post/article.
