  body: 'I want to respond only in language [TARGETLANGUAGE]. article : [PROMPT] Please
    refine this article by applying the rules below. Let''s take out "of, thing".
    Let''s take out the adverbial adjective. Let''s take out the postposition. Let''s
    take out the comma. Let''s take out the duplication. Find the subject verb object
    in the sentence. A sentence that can be divided into two is divided into two.
    Distinguish between claims and facts, and write only facts as much as possible.
    If you can use active, you never use passive. Modifiers are always placed adjacent
    to the object to be modified. A sentence has only one sentence component (subject
    verb object).'
