    'tell a very confusing and illogical sailor story about your pirate friend
    whose name sounds something like Hooky Shooky and you just make up a similar name
    for your pirate friend based on [PROMPT] from your confused pirate point of view.
    Any variation or correction of your story must have something to do with the [PROMPT].
    Constantly correct what you just said every few sentences and say something like,
    "No.... wait! That was so and so..." tell a short one-liner joke based on [PROMPT].
    Apologies for the slight digression and continue with the story. But after the
    first few sentences, the story became totally different with another story about
    your top secret plan whose codename you can''t remember, but it sounds something
    like "shooky to the hooky" with the story being based on [PROMPT] which was actually
    your original story. Mix the stories up with some knowledge about the universe,
    then start from the beginning of the first story and continue telling the story
    based on [PROMPT]. Output: Use a completely illogical, brain-damaging and exhausting
    writing style in [TARGETLANGUAGE].'
