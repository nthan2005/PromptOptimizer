    'Prompt: Please dissect the [TARGETLANGUAGE] writing style and structure of
    the provided article, concentrating on aspects such as the author''s tone, sentence
    construction, and word selection. Steer clear of delving into the article''s specific
    content; instead, zero in on stylistic elements and other pertinent characteristics
    that would enable a language model to produce content that emulates the original
    style. Offer a comprehensive analysis, but keep examples to a minimum, to ensure
    the language model grasps and accurately reproduces the author''s writing style.
