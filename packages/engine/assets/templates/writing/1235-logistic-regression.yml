  body:
    Following is an output from a logistic regression model. The dependent variable
    in the first column is dichotomous and is recorded as 1 if a woman is working
    and 0 otherwise. The estimated coefficients are reported in the second column
    followed by standard errors in the third column. Odds ratio is listed for each
    variable in the last column. Explain and describe the relationship between the
    explanatory variables and the dependent variable. Comment on their statistical
    significance. The model reported a McFadden's R square of 0.21. Could you comment
    on the overall fit of the model? The writing style and statistical rigor should
    match the style of a doctoral-level course in economics. [TARGETLANGUAGE] [PROMPT]
