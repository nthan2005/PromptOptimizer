  body: 'Generates a progress note from a TCM assisting in a service to [VARIABLE1].
    The progress note is structured in three parts, part 1 BODY OF THE NOTE: Contains
    approximately 250 words in approximately 10 sentences, detailing how the TCM assisted
    in the specified service: [PROMPT] to the customer [VARIABLE1], so formal, explaining
    in the third person, on the basis of teaching him in each step and saving him
    most of the money, taking advantage of the resources for his health conditions.
    At the end of the body of the note there are the other two parts of the note:
    the OUTCOME of the service with about 120 characters in a single sentence and
    the NEXT STEP: which in about 120 characters explains in one sentence the next
    action to the service. The progress note can take the note: [VARIABLE2] as an
    example. The service will be written in the language [TARGETLANGUAGE], and it
    will use [PROMPT] as extra annotations, where it is specified in which location
    the service was performed and if it was with [VARIABLE1] or without it depending
    on assisting it. [VARIABLE1:Client Name] [VARIABLE2: Example of Note] [VARIABLE3:Location]'
