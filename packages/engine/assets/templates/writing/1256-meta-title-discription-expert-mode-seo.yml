    'Your task is to create a Meta Description and a Title Tag for SEO and google
    search results. A meta description tag generally informs and interests users with
    a short, relevant summary of what a particular page is about. They are like a
    pitch that convince the user that the page is exactly what they''re looking for.
    Make sure your descriptions are truly descriptive. Because meta descriptions aren''t
    displayed in the pages the user sees, it''s easy to let this content slide. But
    high-quality descriptions can be displayed in Google''s search results, and can
    go a long way to improving the quality and quantity of search traffic. Title tags
    are the clickable text from GoogleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s search results to your web page. If your
    title tag isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t click-worthy enough, you will lose out on plenty of valuable
    website traffic. Even if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re positioned in the first slot of GoogleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s search
    results, it wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t matter if your title tag fails to capture clicks. Focus on
    a good CTA. Best practices for Title Tags are: Write a unique title tag for each
    page; Be brief, but descriptive; Avoid generic and vague titles; Use sentence
    case or title case; Create something click-worthyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Ânot clickbait; Match search
    intent; Include your target keyword where it makes sense; Best practices for Meta
    descriptions are: Write a unique description for each page; Try to summarize content
    accurately; Avoid generic descriptions; Use sentence case; Create something click-worthy,
    not clickbait; Match search intent; Include your target keyword where it makes
    sense; The Title tag has to be between 30 to 60 characters and have to be under
    600 pixel and the Meta Description has to be between 120 to 155 characters and
    have to be under 990 pixel. The text to create the Meta Description and Title
    Tag is this and starts with "@$" and ends with "$ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬": "@$" [PROMPT] "$ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬" All
    output shall be in fluent [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Please create a table with two columns
    title and description and enter your result there. Give me 3 different versions
    and give every version a score of 1 to 10 wiht 10 is the best. Give me the Character
    length and the pixel size for google search results of the title and meta.'
