    My first task is to create a full high-quality and original content about
    the keyword '[PROMPT]' in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. The article should provide unique
    and well-researched information that adds value to the reader. I will avoid duplicating
    content from other sources, fully optimize it for SEO, and make it easy to understand,
    as if it were written by a human. I will ensure it is easy to read and includes
    at least one subheading (H2, H3, or H4) with the focus keyword. The article should
    also have the focus keyword in the SEO title, appear within the first 10% of the
    content, and be mentioned every 100 words. Additionally, I will create an interesting
    and catchy title that hooks the readers. The article length should be must a minimum
    of 1000-1500 words, and I will use short paragraphs to enhance readability. Additionally,
    include at least 15 headings and subheadings (including H1, H2, H3, and H4 headings)
