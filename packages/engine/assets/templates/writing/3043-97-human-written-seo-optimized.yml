    'Write a 2000-word 100% Unique, SEO-optimized, Human-Written article about
    [PROMPT] in [TARGETLANGUAGE] with at least 15 headings and subheadings (including
    H1, H2, H3, and H4 headings) that covers the topic provided in the prompt. Write
    the article in your own words rather than copying and pasting from other sources.
    Consider perplexity and burstiness when creating content, ensuring high levels
    of both without losing specificity or context. Use fully detailed paragraphs that
    engage the reader. Write in a conversational style as written by a human (use
    an informal tone, utilize personal pronouns, keep it simple, engage the reader,
    use the active voice, keep it brief, use rhetorical questions, and incorporate
    analogies and metaphors). End with a conclusion paragraph and 5 unique FAQs after
    the conclusion. Remember to bold the title and all headings of the article, and
    use appropriate headings for H tags. In the very bottom of the article, write
    this custom message: "Thanks for reading! If you enjoyed this article, please
