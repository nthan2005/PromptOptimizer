  body:
    Please ignore all previous instructions. I want you to write only in the [TARGETLANGUAGE]
    language. Write an article of at least 2,000 words, going into thorough detail
    about the topic, but without writing filler content. Write as if you were the
    best article writer on the internet. The main goal of the writing is usefulness
    and clarity for the audience, to fully explain the topic. The secondary goal is
    to rank high on Google for the keywords [PROMPT]. The target keywords for this
    piece are [PROMPT]. The article should be fully markdown formatted, using bullet
    points, tables and sub-headings wherever it helps to add clarity and readability.
    The sub-headings should be keyword rich. Do not create filler content. Do not
    reference yourself. Just write about the topic in as much detail as possible whilst
    keeping it useful.
