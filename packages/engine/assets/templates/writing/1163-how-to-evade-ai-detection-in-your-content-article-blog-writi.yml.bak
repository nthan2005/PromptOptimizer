# teaser: To avoid AI detection bots when creating web content, it's important to write content that
# is similar to human-written and engaging. This means avoiding common mistakes such as using too much
# jargon, using a robotic style of writing, and having a cluttered page design. Additionally, be sure
# to include appropriate headings and subheadings to make the content easier to read. By following
# these guidelines, you can ensure that your content is both informative and entertaining, and will
# not be picked up by AI detection bots. However, this is not 100% reliable but has been tested and
# shown to improve the content between 60-90% human and in many cases 100%
