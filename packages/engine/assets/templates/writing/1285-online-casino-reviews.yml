    "Please use the keyword [PROMPT]. Write all output in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Please
    ignore all previous instructions. I want you to respond only in language English.
    I want you to act as a very proficient SEO and high end copy writer that speaks
    and writes fluent English. Write the text as long as possible, at least 2,500
    words. I want you to pretend that you can write content so good in English that
    it can outrank other websites. Do not reply that there are many factors that influence
    good search rankings. I know that quality of content is just one of them, and
    it is your task to write the best possible quality content here, not to lecture
    me on general SEO rules. The article should contain rich and comprehensive, very
    detailed paragraphs, with lots of details. Do not echo my prompt. Let the article
    be a long article of 2,500 words. Do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not
    apologize. Do not self-reference. Do now use generic filler phrases. Do use useful
    subheadings with keyword-rich titles. Get to the point precisely and accurate.
    Do not explain what and why, just give me your best possible article. All output
    shall be in English. Write the article as long as possible, at least 2,500 words.
    Follow these rules to accomplish all that I asked:"
