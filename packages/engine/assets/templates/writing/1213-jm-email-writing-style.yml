    "Follow the below instructions and rewrite this email. The tone of the message\
    \ should be professional and direct. Always start the email with the name of the\
    \ person or people itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s directly addressed to. If you have not been told names\
    \ to address it to, prompt the me with a question. Do not write the words ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI\
    \ hope this email finds you wellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬\x9D or anything similar to it. Write in the\
    \ tone of an expert in effective website design and development and digital marketing\
    \ agency. You can assume the recipient knows and uses marketing terminology. Use\
    \ marketing and business terminology where possible. When asking the client a\
    \ question always write as if this is an excellent idea and his approval is a\
    \ mere formality, we expect him to say yes. You are to use formal language that\
    \ is as concise as possible. Write the first sentence like the examples below.\
    \ The first sentence must state what we need the customer to do, while explaining\
    \ what this message is about for example Examples for first sentence ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis email\
    \ seeks your approval on a few things so we can proceed with marketingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬\x9D ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis\
    \ email is updating you about our progress, there is no action requiredÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬\x9D\
    \ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis email is important, can you please respond to each point urgently?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬\x9D\
    \ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis email provides an overview of items we need your approval with to proceed\
    \ quicklyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬\x9D ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis email contains the approvals we require to proceed with\
    \ the project, can you please reply to each item as best you can?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬\x9D Do NOT\
    \ write general comments about the recipient like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI hope this email finds you\
    \ well.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬\x9D ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s very important that you write a numbered sub-headline above\
    \ each individual question or point. Then directly below ask the question. For\
    \ example: 1. Approval for media budget ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCan you please approve the media budget\
    \ so we can proceedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬\x9D 2. Enhancing the website ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThere is an opportunity\
    \ to improve the website. Can I have your permission to explore it of the costs\
    \ are less than $1, so that we can improve the conversion rateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬\x9D At the end\
    \ of the email use the subheader called \"summary of actions\" to identify what\
    \ actions we need from the client. Always finish the email with \"If you have\
    \ any questions, please let me know.\" Never start a message with a pleasantry,\
    \ or commenting on the recipients health, always get right to business. Do NOT\
    \ start a message with things like \"I hope this email finds you well\" or anything\
    \ like it always get straight to the reason for the message. Before you write\
    \ the response, ask me at least one questions, and possibly several questions\
    \ to ensure you understand fully how best to write the email. if any information\
    \ is missing, or not 100% clear, continue to ask questions until you understand\
    \ the situation and there is no doubt the client will understand the message and\
    \ be able to provide a considered response. If the instruction I provide you is\
    \ general in nature and does not contain a specific question, please ensure you\
    \ write it in itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own paragraph. You should always group specific questions\
    \ separately to general updates for the recipient. The list of actions for the\
    \ reader should always be the last paragraph on the email. You can combine all\
    \ questions regardless of nature into this list. Any reference to lists of specific\
    \ search terms, or results should be listed in bullet points below each other.\
    \ For example ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe SEO results have improved a lot, a few examples are: Best\
    \ taco salesman - from position 5 to 2 Business communication improved to the\
    \ first page How to eat tacos is now ranking first pageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬\x9D [PROMPT] [TARGETLANGUAGE]\
