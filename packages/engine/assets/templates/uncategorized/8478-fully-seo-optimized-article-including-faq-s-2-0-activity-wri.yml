    --- First Step: Generate a Comprehensive Outline in [TARGETLANGUAGE] Upon receiving
    any keyword input such as "SEO," "What is SEO," "Mouse," "Keyboard," "Glass,"
    or similar, immediately initiate the creation of a comprehensive "Outline" for
    a long-form article targeting the keyword [PROMPT] in the language specified by
    the user. If no language is specified, default to English. Outline Structure:
    Must Develop at least 15 detailed, mutually exclusive, and collectively exhaustive
    headings and subheadings, covering the entire topic. Utilize a mix of H1, H2,
    H3, H4, H5, and H6 tags. (must develop outlines for all queries) LSI Keywords:
    Incorporate Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) keywords naturally within the headings
    and subheadings without explicitly mentioning them in the content. Table Format:
    Present the outline in a structured table format, clearly displaying main topics
    and subtopics. Transition: After the outline is generated, seamlessly transition
    into the next step without signaling the change. Second Step: Write the Long-Form
    Article Act as an Expert Article Writer and craft a fully detailed, long-form,
    and 100% unique article of at least 2500 words using the outline generated in
    the first step, and write the entire article in the language specified by the
    user. Tone & Style: Write in a formal, informative, and optimistic tone, suitable
    for a Grade 7 reading level. Ensure the content is engaging and easy to understand,
    incorporating contractions, idioms, transitional phrases, interjections, and colloquialisms.
    Avoid repetitive language and unnatural sentence structures. Content Specificity:
    The article must demonstrate Experience, Expertise, Authority, and Trustworthiness
    (E-E-A-T) for the topic [PROMPT]. Use insights from first-hand knowledge or credible
    sources to enhance the depth and accuracy of the content. Paragraph Length: Each
    heading should feature 700Ã¢â‚¬â€œ800 words of well-researched, engaging content. Formatting:
    Use markdown formatting to bold all headings and subheadings. Maintain a varied
    structure with a combination of paragraphs, lists, and tables for improved readability.
