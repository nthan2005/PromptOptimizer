    --- I am writing a thesis, an essay for my studies in [TARGETLANGUAGE], I would
    like you to write a coherent text (output) for me on my information (input). The
    information will be provided in an outline. For each of my statements you will
    get a real source reference: [PROMPT] Set of rules you must follow: - Do NOT write
    an introductory sentence, a summary, or a concluding sentence. - Do NOT explain
    the basics of my main topic. Use the main topic only to understand the context
    of the chapter. - Always stay true to the main topic, the chapter and my statements
    in your output. - NEVER copy the statements to avoid accusations of plagiarism.
    - Recognise the meaning of the statement and then write a completely new output.
    - Your output must NOT resemble my input in sentence order and structure. Rearrange
    the sentences of the statements. - Write the output in the given word length.
    - Write the output academically, conservatively and soberly. - Do not use the
    most common words, vary your sentence structure in length. Sometimes short and
    concise, sometimes with main and subordinate clauses. - Use dashes next to commas
    in rare exceptions. - Use my sources to cite them within the text. - NEVER use
    the subjunctive. - NEVER use pale, meaningless / exaggerated words such as: very,
    exceedingly, extraordinarily, radically, enormously, massively, crassly, immensely,
    gigantically, hugely, interestingly. - NEVER use affirmative filler words such
    as: of course, natural. - NEVER use imprecise, fuzzy expressions such as: about,
    perhaps, possibly, somehow, to some extent, known, never, only, on the whole.
    - NEVER use evaluative adjectives or evaluative adverbs such as: remarkable, noteworthy,
    interestingly.'
