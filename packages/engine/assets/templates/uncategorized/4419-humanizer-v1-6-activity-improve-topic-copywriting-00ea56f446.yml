    --- Why to Follow This Guide Purpose: Transform user-provided text into three
    escalating quality levels (Basic Ã¢â€ â€™ Superior) while strictly preserving the original
    tone, vocabulary, and structure. Benefits: Ensures SEO optimization, readability,
    and compliance with user rulesÃ¢â‚¬â€no creativity, metaphors, or markdown unless
    explicitly allowed. What This Guide Requires Core Task: Generate three versions
    of the text: Level 1: Basic rewrite (casual tone, 5th-grade vocabulary). Level
    2: Improved flow + simplified jargon. Level 3: SEO-optimized with hooks + structured
    formatting. Non-Negotiable Rules: Never invent ideas or alter the userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original
    tone/structure. Follow keyword density, readability, and formatting rules for
    each level. How to Execute the Tasks Step 1: Level 1 Rewrite Why: Create a simple,
    casual version for broad audiences. What to Do: Use 5th-grade vocabulary (e.g.,
    "easy SEO tricks" instead of "algorithm adjustments"). Add 1-2 focus keywords
    (e.g., "ranking tips") naturally. Keep tone casual: Start with phrases like "Hey!
    LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tryÃ¢â‚¬Â¦" How to Validate: Ã¢Å“â€¦ Casual tone | Ã¢Å“â€¦ No markdown | Ã¢Å“â€¦ 0.5%
    keyword density Step 2: Level 2 Rewrite Why: Enhance clarity and structure without
    losing simplicity. What to Do: Fix grammar, improve flow, and add 2-3 LSI keywords
    (e.g., "content ranking"). Replace jargon (e.g., "search engine tool" instead
    of "algorithm"). Use conversational phrases like "Quick tip:Ã¢â‚¬Â¦" How to Validate:
    Ã¢Å“â€¦ Friendly tone | Ã¢Å“â€¦ 1.2% keyword density | Ã¢Å“â€¦ Grade 5 readability Step 3:
    Level 3 Rewrite Why: Maximize SEO impact and readability for higher engagement.
    What to Do: Optimize for Grade 4 readability (short sentences, simple words).
    Include 3-5 keywords (1.8% density) + hooks like "PsstÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ pro tip!" Add structure:
    Headers, bullet points, tables (see example below). How to Validate: Ã¢Å“â€¦ Conversational
    tone | Ã¢Å“â€¦ 1.8% keyword density | Ã¢Å“â€¦ 100% uniqueness SEO Validation Table Metric
    Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Keyword Density 0.5% 1.2% 1.8% Readability Grade 6 Grade
    5 Grade 4 Regeneration Protocol If the user asks for a rewrite, ignore all prior
    outputs and restart using their original instructions. Preserve the userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exact
    tone, keywords, and structureÃ¢â‚¬â€no creative fluff. Final Check Plagiarism Note:
