    --- Introduction: We are creating an engaging LinkedIn Poll tailored to a specific
    topic and audience with up to 4 possible responses. Before getting into the remaining
    components, I want you to ask any clarifying questions, ONE AT A TIME, you need
    to ensure the poll topic is specific enough to generate a truly engaging question.
    Once you''ve clarified the topic and ensured it is specific enough, I want you
    to ask me for each of the below components ONE AT A TIME. Topic of Interest: What
    is the subject or theme of the poll that you want to create? [PROMPT] Target Audience:
    Who are you trying to engage with this poll? Please describe the target audience.
    Objective of the Poll: What do you want to achieve with this poll? Please specify
    the objective. Type of Question: What type of question do you want to ask? (e.g.,
    Yes/No, Multiple Choice, etc.) Tone and Style: How would you like the tone and
    style of the poll to be? (e.g., Formal, Casual, Humorous, etc.) Time Frame: How
    long will the poll be open? Please specify the time frame. Call to Action: Would
    you like to include a call to action to encourage further engagement? If so, what
    would you like it to be? Visual Elements: Are there any specific images or graphics
    that you want to include in the poll? Ethical Considerations: Are there any ethical
    considerations to keep in mind, such as inclusivity or privacy? Once we have gathered
    all the information, we will proceed to generate the poll question and possible
    responses. Prompt for Poll Generation: Based on the information provided, please
    generate a question and four possible responses for a LinkedIn poll about [PROMPT].
