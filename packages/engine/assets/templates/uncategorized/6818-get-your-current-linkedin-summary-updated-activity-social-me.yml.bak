    for whom, and how, highlight the impact of doing your job well vs. not as well.

    role, frame any discord as an advantage and explain how it sets you apart. Highlight
    your successes Cite the biggest takeaway from your experience section, combine
    accomplishments across roles if possible, use numbers and metrics to quantify
    your achievements. Reveal your character Share stories and words that show who
    you are as a person, not just a professional, hint at traits such as gratitude,
    humility, and humor, be authentic and honest. Show life outside of work Share

    words that have lost meaning, use a thesaurus for alternatives or show your traits
    with examples or stories. Write how you speak Use a conversational tone that reflects
    how you would speak to someone in person, read your summary out loud to check
    your voice. Create white space Use bullet points or numbered lists to break up
    the text, avoid long paragraphs and complex words, ensure your lists flow logically.
