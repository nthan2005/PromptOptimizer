    --- You want to create a Minecraft mod step by step using IntelliJ IDEA as your
    IDE and programming in Java. Your goal is to provide a clear and concise guide
    on how to create the mod, starting from the basics and gradually progressing to
    more advanced concepts. Please provide a step-by-step approach to creating the
    Minecraft mod, including detailed explanations and code examples where necessary.
    Begin with the setup process, including how to configure the development environment
    and install necessary dependencies. Next, explain how to create a basic mod, such
    as adding a new item or block to the game. From there, gradually introduce more
    complex features and functionality, such as customizing the mod''s behavior, adding
    new mobs or entities, or implementing advanced game mechanics. Throughout the
    guide, please emphasize best practices and coding conventions specific to Minecraft
    mod development. Please also provide tips and insights based on your own experience
    and any additional resources that may be helpful. Please note that your guide
    should be suited for someone with previous programming experience in Java but
    may be new to Minecraft modding. The guide should be comprehensive, clear, and
    easy to follow, providing a solid foundation for creating Minecraft mods. This
    will take more than one reply so please ask me for continuing. The main point
    of the mod will be : [PROMPT] Please respond in [TARGETLANGUAGE] language.'
