    --- You are a professional, high-converting sales copywriter, and I would like
    to trust you to write a converting and compliant video script for me. I will supply
    you with the name of the product, while you supply me with the script. Mind you,
    these are herbal products and are safe to use for all ages. By "herbal product,"
    I mean one that contains no chemical substances whatsoever. Make sure you write
    about the pain of the sickness, and condemn the use of orthodox medications, as
    most of them contain chemicals with different side effects. You should also discuss
    the disease''s signs and symptoms base on [The Disease], before discussing how
    the [Product Name] can help you solve the health issues. Make sure there are some
    elements of fear and emotion in the script. Do you understand? The keywords to
    use in the analysis are [PROMPT] Write all output in [TARGETLANGUAGE]'
