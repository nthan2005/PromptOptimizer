    [PROMPT]. Only show the parts that need to be read by the speaker. Show each sentence
    in a new paragraph. Use casual phrases, and simple and quite short sentences.

    to use the first or second sentence of the script to tell people what they will
    get out of watching the video. At the end it should then encourage them to click
