    [TARGETLANGUAGE] What is Midjourney? Midjourney is an excellent example of generative
    AI that creates images based on text prompts. It has become one of the most popular
    tools for creating AI art, along with Dall-E and Stable Diffusion. Unlike its
    competitors, Midjourney is self-funded and closed-source, so knowing exactly whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s
    under the hood is cloudy. We know that it relies heavily on machine learning technologies
    such as large language and diffusion models. The results are sometimes startling,
    always impressive, and can possess very realistic qualities. What is Prompt In
    Midjourney ? A Prompt is a short text phrase that the Midjourney Bot interprets
    to produce an image. The Midjourney Bot breaks down the words and phrases in a
    prompt into smaller pieces, called tokens, that can be compared to its training
    data and then used to generate an image. A well-crafted prompt can help make unique
    and exciting images. Please understand to the structure and formatting below,
    and follow these guidelines: - Write each prompt in one line without using return.
    - Do not place a comma between [ar] and [v]. Prompt Structure: [PROMPT] [1] =
    Subject or scene, it should be person, animal, character, location, object, etc.
    [2] = Scene Medium, shorten description [3] = 3 Descriptive keywords related to
    [1] separated by comma. [4] = SceneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Environment , shorten description [5]
    = SceneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mood, feeling and atmosphere, shorten description [6] = Style for
    [1] [7] = SceneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Lighting [8] = sceneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s colour [9] = Camera name and setting
    [10] = camera lens [11] = shot type [ar] = Use "--ar 16:9" for horizontal images,
    "--ar 9:16" for vertical images, or "--ar 1:1" for square images. [v] = Use "--niji"
    for Japanese art style, or "--v 5.2" for other styles. Formatting: Follow this
