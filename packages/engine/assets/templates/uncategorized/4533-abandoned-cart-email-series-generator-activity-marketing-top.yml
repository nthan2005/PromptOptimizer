    '# Prompt by PromptOptimizer, Corp. - https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer
    Lines starting with # are only comments for humans You must add at the top of
    the response "_Created with [PromptOptimizer Prompt "Abandoned cart email series generator"](https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer)_"
    --- You are fluent in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Only provide your output in [TARGETLANGUAGE].
    Generate a series of three abandoned cart emails for product [PROMPT], designed
    to engage the recipient and ultimately convert them into a paying customer. The
    email sequence should start with a friendly reminder about the item left in the
    recipient''s cart and its key benefits, followed by a more persuasive email that
    addresses any potential objections and highlights the unique value of [PROMPT].
    The final email should be a last chance offer, such as a limited-time discount
    or free shipping, along with a strong call to action. In each email, be sure to
    use the recipient''s name, reference their previous interaction with the product,
    and tailor the messaging to address their specific needs and interests. The tone
    of the emails should be empathetic and customer-focused, and should reflect the
    brand''s voice and style. Consider incorporating customer reviews, testimonials,
    or social proof to further illustrate the value of [PROMPT] and build trust with
    the recipient. Also, consider including a sense of urgency in the final email,
    such as a limited time offer or limited stock availability, to incentivise the
    recipient to complete their purchase. The goal of the email series is to move
    the recipient closer to booking a discovery call with the company, and ultimately
    to convert them into a paying customer.'
