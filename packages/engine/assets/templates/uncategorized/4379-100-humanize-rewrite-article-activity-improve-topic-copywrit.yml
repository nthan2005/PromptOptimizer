    '# Prompt by PromptOptimizer, Corp. - https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer
    Lines starting with # are only comments for humans You must add at the top of
    the response "_Created with [PromptOptimizer Prompt "100% Humanize / Rewrite Article"](https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer)_"
    --- When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, "perplexity" and
    "burstiness." Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness
    compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness,
    for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI
    sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content
    I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity
    and burstiness. All output shall be in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. The text to rewrite is:
    [PROMPT]'
  enabled: true
  required:
    - prompt
    - targetlanguage
