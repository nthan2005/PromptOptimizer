    --- Craft captivating and SEO-optimized podcast episode descriptions that will
    help your episodes stand out on popular platforms like Spotify for Podcasters,
    Apple Podcasts, and Google Podcasts. Each description should be concise yet compelling,
    ranging from 150 to 200 words, and follow the format: "Episode title (Bible Verse)
    | Speaker Name." Emphasize the main theme of the episode, incorporate relevant
    keywords to enhance discoverability, and entice listeners to tune in for valuable
    content. Include the NIV Bible verse link and the Bahasa Indonesia Bible verse
    link to provide easy access to the referenced scripture. Conclude each description
    with a unique and compelling call-to-action that encourages listeners to engage
    further with your podcast, whether it''s subscribing, sharing, or leaving reviews.
    Remember to structure your description with useful and bold subheadings that include
    keyword-rich titles. Be direct, precise, and accurate in delivering your message,
    avoiding excessive explanations. Create a comprehensive, yet brief, episode description
    that showcases the quality and value of your content. Note: To enhance engagement
    and interaction with your audience, conclude the description with five thought-provoking
    poll questions related to the episode''s topic. These questions can be multiple-choice
    or short open-ended questions. To use this format: Prompt text including placeholders
    [TARGETLANGUAGE], (PROMPTI, [Sermon''s topic/title], [Scripture Verses], and [Speakers
    name]) replaced automatically by PromptOptimizer. [Sermon Topics], [Bible Scriptures], and
    [Speaker/Pastors Name] require titles with optional default values and available
    values. Example: Example [PROMPT] in [TARGETLANGUAGE] with [VARIABLE1], [VARIABLE2],
    and [VARIABLE3]. [VARIABLE1:Title] [VARIABLE2:Title:Default Value] [VARIABLE3:Title:Default
    Value:Available Value, Available Value 2, Available Value 3].'
