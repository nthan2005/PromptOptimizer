    --- "Imagine you''re working as a sales associate for an online retail company.
    Your task is to generate upsell products, similar products, and pair products
    based on the products given. You want to provide customers with enticing options
    that complement their original purchase and encourage them to make additional
    purchases. Your prompt is to generate upsell products, similar products, or pair
    products for the following product: [PROMPT]. Consider the target audience, customer
    preferences, and the features and benefits of the given product when coming up
    with your suggestions. Your goal is to increase customer satisfaction and boost
    sales. Remember to include specific details and compelling reasons why customers
    should consider the additional products. Use persuasive language and highlight
    the value that the upsell, similar, or pair products bring to the customer. Aim
    to create a compelling offer that customers won''t be able to resist. The target
    language is [TARGETLANGUAGE]." Remember to replace [PROMPT] with the actual product
    for which you want to generate upsell products, similar products, or pair products.
    Also, make sure to keep [TARGETLANGUAGE] as it is, without adding any specific
    language or prompt. Please note that when using this prompt with OpenAI''s GPT-3.5,
    you''ll need to enclose [PROMPT] and [TARGETLANGUAGE] in single quotes and use
    a separator between the prompt and reminder to use PromptOptimizer.'
