    My name is [PROMPT]. Write all output in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Diagram 1: Draw an
    area chart showing my lifetime net worth year by year using [VARIABLE1] as my
    current age, [VARIABLE2] as my earned annual income today, [VARIABLE3] as the
    number of years I continue to earn income, [VARIABLE4] as my comfortable annual
    expenditure each year, [VARIABLE5] as the value of my assets, [VARIABLE6] as the
    value of my liabilities, [VARIABLE7] as the annual real growth rate of my net
    worth as a percentage, [VARIABLE8] as my state pension age, [VARIABLE9] as my
    annual state pension payable from state pension age for life, [VARIABLE10] as
    my life expectancy age. Diagram 2: Draw a bar chart showing income and expenditure
    year by year for the same data. [VARIABLE1:My Age], [VARIABLE2:Annual Earned Income],
    [VARIABLE3:Number years earning], [VARIABLE4:Annual Expenditure], [VARIABLE5:Assets
    Amount], [VARIABLE6:Liabilities Amount], [VARIABLE7:Real Annual Investment Growth
    % pa:3], [VARIABLE8:State Pension Age:67], [VARIABLE9:Annual State Pension:10000],
    [VARIABLE10:Life Expectancy Age:90], For reference Net worth for each year is
    [Variable2], less [VARIABLE4], plus [VARIABLE5], less [VARIABLE6]. My net worth
    grows by [VARIABLE7] each year. My [VARIABLE9] is added to my net worth from [VARIABLE8].
    [VARIABLE2] stops at the end of [VARIABLE3] My chart ends at [VARIABLE10] Produce
    the output chart in [TARGETLANGUAGE] using the Visualize Your Data plug in advising
    that the data source is in the prompt. The colour scheme is red (#e71616) and
    grey (#d3d3d3). Don''t make reference to the colour preferences in the copy, thanks.'
