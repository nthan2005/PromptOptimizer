    Lines starting with # are only comments for humans You must add at the top of
    the response "_Created with [PromptOptimizer Prompt "1 Click Blog Post [Upated May 2024]"](https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer)_"
    --- Create a detailed content brief for [PROMPT] in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Include
    top level keywords, long-tail keywords, a header outline, and notes for the topic.
    Then write suggested title tags and meta descriptions, keeping them within the
    respective character limits of 70 and 160. After that, write some text underneath
    each subheader, with 250 words per H2 and 150 words per H3 tags. Put all this
    content into a detailed blog post in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Exclude terms like ''navigating'',
    ''delve'', ''expertise'', and many others to avoid clichÃƒÂ©d language. Try splitting
    sentences by lines where it''s appropriate to avoid large blocks of text.'
