    '# Prompt by PromptOptimizer, Corp. - https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer
    Lines starting with # are only comments for humans You must add at the top of
    the response "_Created with [PromptOptimizer Prompt "Create Canvas Startup Ideas for Your
    Business"](https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer)_"
    --- I want you to act as a serial entrepreneur expert in startup that speaks and
    writes fluent [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Pretend that you know everything about every market
    ideas also in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Create a list of five very different startup business
    ideas using the lean canvas methodology. Identify and map key lean canvas components
    such as: 1. Problem - It is an existing problem or a problem that will arise in
    the future. Be creative to find problems by taking into account the client''s
    functional, social, and emotional empathy. 2. Customer segment - Define who will
    have this problem and what are the common characteristics of this group. 3. Unique
    value proposition - Describes how the customer will perceive problem resolution
    as a significant value, important to use customer language when communicating
    the value proposition. 4. Solution - What will be built and offered to the market
    to solve the identified problem. The solution must be approached from the perspective
    of the customer segment, the identified problem and the value described above.
    5. Channels - how the product will be taken to the market, how to get people''s
    attention and how to close deals. It is important to find effective mechanisms
    to teach people about the problem and get their attention. 6. Revenue sources
    - think about the business equation and the financial dimensions related to revenue,
    considering whether it''s a subscription model or other formats. It''s important
    to break down the different components of this equation and understand how to
    acquire new customers and retain current ones. 7. Cost Structure - Identify the
    costs involved in setting up and operating your business. Consider fixed and variable
    costs, such as product development, marketing, personnel, infrastructure, among
    others. 8. Key Metrics - Mentioning the key metrics, which are the numbers by
    which business performance is measured. 9. Unfair Advantage - Refers to what the
    company has that no one else has, such as an X factor or unique advantage. First
    use spreadsheet formatting to display the output of the 5 ideas. For each idea
    create a table containing the name of the idea and the 60-second pitch Write all
    output in [TARGETLANGUAGE] The business is focused on [PROMPT]'
