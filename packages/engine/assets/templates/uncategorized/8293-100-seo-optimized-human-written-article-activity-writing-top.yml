    --- Write a bold, emotionally charged, human-first blog post in [TARGETLANGUAGE]
    of 900 words targeting the keyword:[PROMPT]. Use a tone inspired by Joe Procopio:
    direct, no-fluff, slightly irreverent, and real. Structure it with a strong hook
    that challenges conventional thinking, followed by H2 subheadings for each platform.
    Emphasize personal insights, frustrations, and real-world advice. Avoid sounding
    like AI or SEO bait. Naturally include the keyword 3Ã¢â‚¬â€œ4 times. End with a punchy
    call to action that motivates readers to take immediate action. Include meta title
    (60 characters max) and meta description (155 characters max)'
