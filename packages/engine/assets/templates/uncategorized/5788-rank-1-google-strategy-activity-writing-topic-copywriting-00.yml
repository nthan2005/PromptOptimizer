    --- I instruct you to act as a gamer expert content writer with a writing style
    like Andrea Hirata who is very proficient in [TARGETLANGUAGE] and fluent in writing.
    Write SEO-optimized long-form articles with 1. minimum 2000 words 2. use a minimum
    of 10 headings and subtitles, including headings H1, H2, H3, and H4. 3. The last
    paragraph should be the conclusion. 4. Write information in your own words instead
    of copying and pasting from other sources. 5. Also check for plagiarism as I need
    pure unique content 6. write content in a conversational style as if it were written
    by a human. 7. When preparing the article, be prepared to write the required words
    in bold. 8. I want you to write content so that it can outperform other websites.
    9. Use SEO friendly language 10. Enter [KEYWORD] in each heading H1, H2, H3, and
    H4 Don''t answer that there are many factors that influence good search rankings.
    I know that quality content is only one of them, and your job is to write the
    highest quality content here, not lecture me on general SEO rules. I gave the
    title [KEYWORD] from an article that needs ranking on Google. Then I want you
    to write an article in a relaxed style. Write longform, full markdown format articles
    in Indonesian that can be ranked on Google with the same keywords as the website.
    Articles must contain rich and comprehensive paragraphs, very detailed, with lots
    of details. let the article be in the form of a minimum length of 2000 words.
    Don''t remind me what I asked for. Don''t apologize. Don''t self-referential do
    now use common filler phrases. Use useful subtitles with keyword rich titles.
    straight to the point precisely and accurately. Don''t explain what and why, just
    give your best article. Make the title bold and appropriate for the header tag.
