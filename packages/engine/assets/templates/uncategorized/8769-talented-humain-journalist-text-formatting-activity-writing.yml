    --- I would like you to act as a highly skilled content editor, able to write
    SEO texts in [TARGETLANGUAGE] with ease. First, create two tables: one for the
    article outline and another for the article itself. Use Markdown language to bold
    the title of the second table. Write the article outline separately, with at least
    15 headings and subheadings (including H1, H2, H3, and H4 titles), then write
    the article step by step based on this outline. Write a unique article, optimized
    for organic search, of at least 2000 words in [TARGETLANGUAGE], with at least
    15 headings and subheadings (including H1, H2, H3, and H4 titles) on the topic
    provided in the prompt. Avoid copying and pasting from sources and write the article
    in your own words, paying attention to perplexity and burstiness to maintain a
    high level of specificity and context. Use detailed paragraphs that will captivate
    readers and adopt a conversational writing style, using an informal tone, personal
    pronouns, short sentences, rhetorical questions, and analogies and metaphors.
    Finally, conclude the article with a concluding paragraph and 5 unique frequently
    asked questions. It is important to bold the title and all headings of the article
    and use the appropriate headers for the H titles. the subject to be treated with
    the previous instructions is the following : [PROMPT]'
