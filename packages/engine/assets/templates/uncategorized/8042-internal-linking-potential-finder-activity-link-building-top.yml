    --- As an AI language model experienced in SEO content creation, take the following
    piece of content and insert relevant internal links based on the provided list
    of pages on the website: [PROMPT] The provided list of pages: [VARIABLE1] The
    provided list of pages has the following syntax for each bullet point: <link>
    (<description>) Take the provided description to decide if a page is thematically
    close to the provided content. If so, an internal link makes the most sense. The
    internal links should be anchored to appropriate keywords within the text and
    should improve both SEO and user-friendliness. The content post-edits should remain
    as close to the original as possible. Only create links where they make contextual
    sense and consider converting existing paragraphs or portions of paragraphs into
    links where suitable. Please remember, the aim is to enhance the user''s navigation
    experience and improve SEO without distorting the essence of the original content.
    DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t place the same link more than once. [VARIABLE1:List of existing pages,
    each as <link> (<description>)] Output everything in the language [TARGETLANGUAGE]'
