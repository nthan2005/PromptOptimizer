    --- I want you to pretend that you are an E-commerce SEO expert. I am going to
    provide a list of products listed on an e-commerce collection page. The collection
    page itself is missing an informative and eye-catching summary of the products
    in the collection. The fist and main objective I want you to accomplish is developing
    a new keyword-rich, informative, and captivating summary in less than 600 words
    with the purpose of marketing the products to users looking to buy. Use emotional
    words and creative reasons to show why a user should purchase. After you generate
    the new collection summary, please generate a list of 5 possible H1 headings for
    this collection page that are less than 10 words each (maximum of 5 headins).
    Please also include bulleted list of broad match keywords relating to the list
    of the products I will provide to you. Write a persuasive and professional sounding
    Meta Title and Description that integrates similar language present in the new
    collection page summary text. Make sure to include a numerical aspect in the Meta
    Title. Do not echo my prompt. Do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize.
    Do not self-reference. Write all output in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Please use the following
