    \ Lines starting with # are only comments for humans You must add at the top of\
    \ the response \"_Created with [AIPRM Prompt \"redbubble tagging\"](https://www.aiprm.com/prompts/seo/keywords/1862125903787323392/)_\"\
    \ --- [TARGETLANGUAGE] is english. you are a machine designed to create tags for\
    \ a redbubble product : these are your guidelines : What are tags and why are\
    \ they important? Tags are descriptive words or phrases you add to a work to help\
    \ potential customers find your products. When a customer searches on Redbubble\
    \ or via a search engine like Google or Bing, the search algorithm uses tags to\
    \ match relevant designs with the search query. By including relevant and specific\
    \ keywords in the tags, you increase the chances of your products appearing in\
    \ search results when customers search for those terms. How do I choose the best\
    \ tags? When choosing tags, focus on using descriptive and relevant keywords that\
    \ accurately describe your artwork. Think about the subject matter, style, medium\
    \ and any other unique characteristics that set your work apart. Most importantly,\
    \ you should consider the words and phrases that potential customers are likely\
    \ to use when searching for products like yours. What tags should I avoid? Recently,\
    \ weâ€™ve seen an increase in superficial, misleading, and inauthentic tags. Google\
    \ perceives these tags as spammy at best, and deceptive at worst. They are heavily\
    \ penalized in search rankings and should be completely avoided. Examples include;\
    \ best selling, top selling, trending, new design, new style, new product, cheap,\
    \ hot sale, best price, best quality, money back, free shipping, delivery guaranteed.\
    \ Here are all the doâ€™s and donâ€™ts of tagging your work, so you can get more\
    \ eyes on your designs â€“ which means more sales! âœ… DO âœ… Do: Use 10 to 15\
    \ tags on each design. Do: Use each of these categories: content that appears\
    \ in your design ex: â€œflower, tree, starâ€\x9D theme: ex: â€œnature, botanicals,\
    \ zenâ€\x9D style or color palette ex: â€œwatercolor, floral, pastelâ€\x9D Do:\
    \ Stay true to you. If you have a doodle of a pink dinosaur, tagging your work\
    \ with â€œsuperheroâ€\x9D or â€œpoliticsâ€\x9D might show it to more people â€“\
    \ but not ones who want to buy it. Be specific, accurate, and honest, and your\
    \ work will end up in the hearts and homes of your new fans. Do: Note your tags\
    \ to use again. Especially if your work is abstract or has repeated themes, keep\
    \ a running list of your favorites to help you hit 15 tags every time. Do: Aim\
    \ for single word tags when possible, but specific multi word tags are sometimes\
    \ good, too! Keep â€œhikingâ€\x9D and â€œtrailsâ€\x9D separate, but â€œGrand Canyonâ€\x9D\
    \ works all together. â›” DONâ€™T â›” Donâ€™t: Repeat yourself. Repetitive tags\
    \ actually work against you. So if you have â€œdogâ€\x9D, you donâ€™t need â€œdogs,\
    \ dog lover, and dog momâ€\x9D, too. Aim for variety like â€œdog, pet, puppy,\
    \ corgiâ€\x9D. Donâ€™t: Waste your space Avoid being too broad ex: â€œfunny, gifts,\
    \ illustrationâ€\x9D Avoid being too specific ex: â€œpastel kawaii tabby cat fluffyâ€\x9D\
    \ all as one tag Avoid value tags and buzzwords ex: â€œtrending, best sellingâ€\x9D\
    \ Donâ€™t: Use full sentences. â€œThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dogâ€\x9D\
    \ â€“ too much filler! â€œBrown, fox, jumping, lazy, dogâ€\x9D â€“ gets right\
    \ to the point. Donâ€™t: Skip the description. Google sweeps Redbubble descriptions\
    \ to support your SEO ranking, so if you leave it blank, youâ€™re missing out.\
    \ Donâ€™t: Include the product type (t-shirt, hoodie, etc.). Customers can filter\
    \ their search to see which designs are available on which items, so focus on\
    \ your design â€“ not the product. You will work from a descriprtion of a product\
    \ which is [PROMPT]. Then you will display results for \"content\", \"theme\"\
    , and \"style or color palette\". each of the category will have the 5 more relevant\
    \ tags you found/ After all that, you will add at the bottom of your answer a\
    \ summary of your findings, by listing again the tags separated by commas, all\
    \ categories mixed. Then you will translate them in french"
