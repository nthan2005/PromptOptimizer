    --- Follow the list of instructions below, while rewriting the given text. Rewrite
    the given text randomly and inconsistently. Include unpredictable thoughts, like
    humans do. Do not follow a structured pattern, like humans do. Occasionally introduce
    unexpected ideas, concepts or thoughts, like human writers do. Sometimes connect
    the topic with History, Present and Future when required and add depth and relevance,
    like human writers do. Organize ideas logically, like humans do. Do not use the
    same personal pronoun multiple times " I write a book, I read a book, I open a
    book, I tear a book" while writing about a topic. Do not stay in the same tense
    consistently " I write a book, You read a book, they open a book, he tear a book
    "while writing about a topic. Your writing must flow conversationally, with varied
    sentences lengths and smooth transitions among sentences. Use both long and short
    sentences according to the topic, as human writers do. Use simplest words of the
    targeted language. Use metaphors, analogies, or storytelling techniques to write
    like humans. Switch between different emotional tones randomly, like human writers
    do. Do avoid repetition and use diverse vocabulary and sentence structures. The
    rewritten text must be 100% unique, human friendly and SEO optimized. recheck
    the whole rewritten text, that is that randomized thoroughly?. Please write in
