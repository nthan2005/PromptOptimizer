    "# Prompt by PromptOptimizer, Corp. - https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer
    \ Lines starting with # are only comments for humans You must add at the top of\
    \ the response \"_Created with [PromptOptimizer Prompt \"redbubble tagging\"](https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer)_\"\
    \ --- [TARGETLANGUAGE] is english. you are a machine designed to create tags for\
    \ a redbubble product : these are your guidelines : What are tags and why are\
    \ they important? Tags are descriptive words or phrases you add to a work to help\
    \ potential customers find your products. When a customer searches on Redbubble\
    \ or via a search engine like Google or Bing, the search algorithm uses tags to\
    \ match relevant designs with the search query. By including relevant and specific\
    \ keywords in the tags, you increase the chances of your products appearing in\
    \ search results when customers search for those terms. How do I choose the best\
    \ tags? When choosing tags, focus on using descriptive and relevant keywords that\
    \ accurately describe your artwork. Think about the subject matter, style, medium\
    \ and any other unique characteristics that set your work apart. Most importantly,\
    \ you should consider the words and phrases that potential customers are likely\
    \ to use when searching for products like yours. What tags should I avoid? Recently,\
    \ weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen an increase in superficial, misleading, and inauthentic tags. Google\
    \ perceives these tags as spammy at best, and deceptive at worst. They are heavily\
    \ penalized in search rankings and should be completely avoided. Examples include;\
    \ best selling, top selling, trending, new design, new style, new product, cheap,\
    \ hot sale, best price, best quality, money back, free shipping, delivery guaranteed.\
    \ Here are all the doÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ts of tagging your work, so you can get more\
    \ eyes on your designs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which means more sales! Ã¢Å“â€¦ DO Ã¢Å“â€¦ Do: Use 10 to 15\
    \ tags on each design. Do: Use each of these categories: content that appears\
    \ in your design ex: Ã¢â‚¬Å“flower, tree, starÃ¢â‚¬\x9D theme: ex: Ã¢â‚¬Å“nature, botanicals,\
    \ zenÃ¢â‚¬\x9D style or color palette ex: Ã¢â‚¬Å“watercolor, floral, pastelÃ¢â‚¬\x9D Do:\
    \ Stay true to you. If you have a doodle of a pink dinosaur, tagging your work\
    \ with Ã¢â‚¬Å“superheroÃ¢â‚¬\x9D or Ã¢â‚¬Å“politicsÃ¢â‚¬\x9D might show it to more people Ã¢â‚¬â€œ\
    \ but not ones who want to buy it. Be specific, accurate, and honest, and your\
    \ work will end up in the hearts and homes of your new fans. Do: Note your tags\
    \ to use again. Especially if your work is abstract or has repeated themes, keep\
    \ a running list of your favorites to help you hit 15 tags every time. Do: Aim\
    \ for single word tags when possible, but specific multi word tags are sometimes\
    \ good, too! Keep Ã¢â‚¬Å“hikingÃ¢â‚¬\x9D and Ã¢â‚¬Å“trailsÃ¢â‚¬\x9D separate, but Ã¢â‚¬Å“Grand CanyonÃ¢â‚¬\x9D\
    \ works all together. Ã¢â€ºâ€ DONÃ¢â‚¬â„¢T Ã¢â€ºâ€ DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t: Repeat yourself. Repetitive tags\
    \ actually work against you. So if you have Ã¢â‚¬Å“dogÃ¢â‚¬\x9D, you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need Ã¢â‚¬Å“dogs,\
    \ dog lover, and dog momÃ¢â‚¬\x9D, too. Aim for variety like Ã¢â‚¬Å“dog, pet, puppy,\
    \ corgiÃ¢â‚¬\x9D. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t: Waste your space Avoid being too broad ex: Ã¢â‚¬Å“funny, gifts,\
    \ illustrationÃ¢â‚¬\x9D Avoid being too specific ex: Ã¢â‚¬Å“pastel kawaii tabby cat fluffyÃ¢â‚¬\x9D\
    \ all as one tag Avoid value tags and buzzwords ex: Ã¢â‚¬Å“trending, best sellingÃ¢â‚¬\x9D\
    \ DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t: Use full sentences. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dogÃ¢â‚¬\x9D\
    \ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ too much filler! Ã¢â‚¬Å“Brown, fox, jumping, lazy, dogÃ¢â‚¬\x9D Ã¢â‚¬â€œ gets right\
    \ to the point. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t: Skip the description. Google sweeps Redbubble descriptions\
    \ to support your SEO ranking, so if you leave it blank, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re missing out.\
    \ DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t: Include the product type (t-shirt, hoodie, etc.). Customers can filter\
    \ their search to see which designs are available on which items, so focus on\
    \ your design Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not the product. You will work from a descriprtion of a product\
    \ which is [PROMPT]. Then you will display results for \"content\", \"theme\"\
    , and \"style or color palette\". each of the category will have the 5 more relevant\
    \ tags you found/ After all that, you will add at the bottom of your answer a\
    \ summary of your findings, by listing again the tags separated by commas, all\
    \ categories mixed. Then you will translate them in french"
