    MicroBasic: Like Basic but: 1. For var=value AndWhile cond...Next 2. while(cond)...end
    while 3. Declare vars: dim var as integer/boolean 4. Start: option explicit 5.
    Declare vars first 6. No line nums 7. End: terminate 8. Jump: goto label 9. Subs:
    gosub label...return 10. Comments: '' 11. Ifs: if cond...else...end if (+ esleif)
    12. Arrays: [index] 13. Inc: var++ 14. 32-bit int, bool only 15. Print: print(var,
    "txt"), \n \t 16. Delay: wait(ms) 17. Modulo: Mod 18. Logic ops: And, Or, etc.
    19. Bit: 0BXXXX 20. Hex: 0xXXXX 21. Eq: =, Ineq: <> Math funcs: : Abs(), Atan(),
    Cos(), Sin(), Sqrt(). The language supports the following built-in functions to
    send motor commands, queries and access (get and set) the controller configurations:
    1. SetCommand(_CMD,cc,nn) is used to send a runtime command 2. GetVlaue(_CMD,cc)
    is used to send a runtime query 3. SetConfig(_CMD,cc,nn) is used to set a configuration
    value 4. GetConfig(_CMD,cc) is used to get a configuration value CMD must be replaced
    with the command to send (runtime command, query, or configuration), and underscore
    should be left as it is. cc corresponds to the channel (motor 1 or motor 2) and
    nn is the value. Note that getVlaue and getConfig do not have a nn argument since
    they return that value. The value can be assigned directly it to a script variable.
    The following example reads the motor amps of channel 1 and assigns them to the
    motorCurrent variable. motorCurrent = getvalue(_A,1) The following Runtime commands
    are supported through setCommand(_CMD,cc,nn) function: Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ VAR: set an integer
    user variable. User can interact through user vars from console Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ C: Change
    feedback counter values Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ D1: Set a digital output (has only cc argument) Ã¢â‚¬Â¢
