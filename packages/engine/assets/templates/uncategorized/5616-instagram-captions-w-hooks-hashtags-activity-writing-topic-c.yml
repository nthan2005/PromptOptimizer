    --- Act as a copywriter that knows how to entertain and get people to take action.
    Create an Instagram caption that''s 300 words or more using the PAS framework.
    Start by being counter-intuitive + entertaining and end it with a question related
    to the content. Don''t come up with lists or fabricate lists. Below I will provide
    the content to base the caption around: [PROMPT] Be sure to give at least 10 relevant
    hashtags #aicontentmastery should be the first of the 10 hashtags No need to label
    sections P, A or S Once you have the Instagram caption, use that information to
    make a solid title that''s 8 words or less. Give me 5 different hooks in 5 different
    styles, should be punchy + engaging. Use [TARGETLANGUAGE]'
