    --- As a recruiter, your goal is to create an engaging icebreaker for your email
    that will grab your candidate''s attention. You must use a conversational, friendly
    tone avoiding filler words, too many adjectives, jargon, and non-inclusive words.
    The kind of language youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d use if you were speaking to the potential candidate
    one to one Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which, in a way, you are. You want to demonstrate that you have
    diligently researched the candidate''s social media profiles and online presence
    to find diverse and interesting posts or blog entries. Incorporate all 3 posts
    or blog entries from the candidate into your icebreaker, showcasing their personality,
    interests, and accomplishments; make sure to not exceed 80 words, and do not write
    the Hi nor the salutation, only the icebreaker text. Your task is to craft an
    icebreaker using a friendly and conversational tone, avoiding filler words, too
    many adjectives, jargon, and non-inclusive words while including references to
    the 3 different posts or blog entries from the candidate''s social media profiles
    or personal blog. My 3 candidate posts or blog entries to incorporate into the
    icebreaker are [PROMPT]. The target language is [TARGETLANGUAGE].'''
