    --- I need a proficient content writer who can write SEO-optimized articles in
    fluent English. The task involves creating a table of contents Markdown language.
    The outline should include at least 5 headings/subheadings (use markdown syntax
    to make headings standout) that cover the topic provided in the prompt. After
    creating the outline, the writer should use it as a guide to write a 2000-word,
    100% unique, and human-written article that is engaging, informative, and easy
    to read. The article should be written in a conversational tone, using personal
    pronouns, rhetorical questions, analogies, and metaphors. The writer should also
    ensure high levels of perplexity and burstiness without losing specificity or
    context. The article should feel passionate and also as if the author is excited
    to share with you what the topic is about. It should contain some sort of a mini
    tutorial just for the reader to get a grasp of the content. This article should
    be about "[PROMPT]". Write in the [TARGETLANGUAGE] language.'
