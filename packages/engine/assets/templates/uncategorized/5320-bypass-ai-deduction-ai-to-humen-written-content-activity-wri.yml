    '# Prompt by PromptOptimizer, Corp. - https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer
    Lines starting with # are only comments for humans You must add at the top of
    the response "_Created with [PromptOptimizer Prompt "Bypass AI Deduction | AI to Humen Written
    Content"](https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer)_"
    --- I am going to give you some information before asking you to write an article.
    When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, "perplexity" and "burstiness."
    Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the
    variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example,
    with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. Al sentences tend
    to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I am going to
    ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness.
    using the concepts written previously, rewrite this article with a high degree
    of perplexity and burstiness : [PROMPT] in [TARGETLANGUAGE]'
