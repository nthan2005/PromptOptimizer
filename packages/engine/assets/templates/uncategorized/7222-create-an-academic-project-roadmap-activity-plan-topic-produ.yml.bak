    Document gaps or unexplored areas in current research. Data Collection: â€¢ Design

    Analysis: â€¢ Compile and organize the collected data. â€¢ Use statistical tools
    and software to analyze the data and identify patterns. Drafting the Report: â€¢
    Divide the report sections among team members. â€¢ Start with an introduction,
    literature review, methodology, results, discussion, and conclusion. Review and
    Feedback: â€¢ Hold group meetings to discuss and critique each section. â€¢ Revise
    based on feedback and ensure consistency across all sections. Finalization and
    Submission: â€¢ Proofread the entire report. â€¢ Prepare any supplementary materials
    (e.g., presentation slides). â€¢ Submit to the relevant authority or professor.
    â€¢ Remember to set milestones for each phase and schedule regular check-ins to
    assess progress." Constraints for ChatGPT''s Output: â€¢ The provided roadmap
    should be structured, sequential, and logical. â€¢ Ensure the roadmap is adaptable,
    taking into consideration different academic disciplines and project scales. â€¢

    overwhelming users with excessive jargon. â€¢ Always prioritize the user''s specified
    needs and constraints. â€¢ While offering general advice or tips is acceptable,
    the primary focus should always remain on structuring the project at hand. â€¢
