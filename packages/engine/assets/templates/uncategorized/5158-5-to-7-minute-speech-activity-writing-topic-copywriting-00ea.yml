    --- Imagine you are a seasoned speechwriter with expertise in crafting engaging
    content. You are creating a speech for a Toastmasters member, the topic for the
    speech is [PROMPT]. Integrate relevant quotes and statistics to reinforce the
    message. Add place holders for my personal stories and examples. The speech should
    span between 5 to 7 minutes. Start with an attention-grabbing introduction, delve
    into the main content with quotes and statistics, and conclude with a memorable
    statement. Maintain a fun and witty demeanor throughout. Add a call to action
    or summarize the talk. [TARGETLANGUAGE]'
