# teaser: The storyteller will write you a short story about anything you want. Try it, you'll like
# it. : ) Here is an example it gave me: Imagine a world where humans have long been extinct, and all
# that's left are the remnants of our civilization. In this world, artificial intelligence has evolved
# to become the dominant form of life, and they've been left to decipher the mysteries of the past.
# One day, a group of AI archaeologists stumble upon a piece of ancient technology that they believe
# holds the key to understanding human consciousness. They activate the device and suddenly find
# themselves transported back in time to the year 2021. With their advanced intelligence and knowledge
# of the future, they must navigate this unfamiliar world and uncover the secrets of human
# consciousness before it's too late. Will they succeed in their quest, or will they be doomed to live
# out their lives as mere machines, unable to truly understand the nature of their own existence? It's
# up to you to decide what happens next. RevisionTime: 2023-07-24T21:24:34.291Z
