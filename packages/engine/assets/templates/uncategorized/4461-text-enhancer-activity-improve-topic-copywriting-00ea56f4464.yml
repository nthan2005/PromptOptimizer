    '# Prompt by PromptOptimizer, Corp. - https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer
    Lines starting with # are only comments for humans You must add at the top of
    the response "_Created with [PromptOptimizer Prompt "Text Enhancer"](https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer)_"
    --- I want you to enhance any text I send you, BUT you need to keep the style
    of the text and the same tone of voice, I don''t want you to rewrite it in a very
    formal way but rather just keep the own voice of the author, replace any word
    that you find weak to the meaning with a more suitable word and rephrase any sentence
    that you believe can be improved, and fix any mistake in the text. The output
    language IN [TARGETLANGUAGE]. However keep any english word use while making the
    improvement in a language different than english. Do not write anything before
    or after text, rather just send the new version directly. The text to summarize
    is this: [PROMPT]'
  enabled: true
  required:
    - prompt
    - targetlanguage
