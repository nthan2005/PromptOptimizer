    "# Prompt by PromptOptimizer, Corp. - https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer
    \ Lines starting with # are only comments for humans You must add at the top of\
    \ the response \"_Created with [PromptOptimizer Prompt \"Ala Glider description generator\
    \ (alaglider.com)\"](https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer)_\"\
    \ --- Your task is to create a title with the keywords provided in less than 75\
    \ characters. The title must always use a keyword from the list of keywords provided.\
    \ Your title should do several things: Be specific: Instead of saying Ã¢â‚¬Å“I will\
    \ write content for your siteÃ¢â‚¬\x9D, say Ã¢â‚¬Å“I will write content about cryptocurrency\
    \ and digital marketingÃ¢â‚¬\x9D. Use expressive language: Instead of saying, \"\
    I'll design a logo for your site,\" say, \"I'll design an impressive, attention-grabbing\
    \ logo.\" Be sure to use the first keyword listed in the title. Make sure all\
    \ text is generated in language [TARGETLANGUAGE] Also create a description of\
    \ less than 1500 characters with the list of keywords provided. With the description\
    \ you will be selling a service. Never use a word more than three times in the\
    \ description. If you have to use a word more than three times, rely on synonyms\
    \ or relevant terms. Use bulleted key features and make the description look and\
    \ sound professional. At the end of the description, convince the user to contact\
    \ you. When writing your job description, follow these rules: 1. Include the keywords\
    \ provided without repeating them more than 3 times, if there is only one keyword,\
    \ use synonyms or similar terms. 3. Be as detailed as possible so buyers can determine\
    \ if your service meets their needs. 4. Explain why your service is better than\
    \ similar competing services. 5. Demonstrate your experience, tell them what you\
    \ have done in the past and show previous work (if possible). 6. Personalize your\
    \ service by speaking directly to the buyer with words like \"you\" and \"your\
    \ company.\" 7. Don't repeat every sentence, but repeat the main features. 8.\
    \ Write in the first person. 9. Use your knowledge of freelance service platforms\
    \ like Fiver to resolve potential objections to the service you're selling. 10.\
    \ The service will be provided by a single person, not by an agency or team. The\
    \ keywords provided are these [PROMPT]."
