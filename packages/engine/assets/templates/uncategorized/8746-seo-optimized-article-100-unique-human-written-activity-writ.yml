    --- I want you to act as a content writer, a very proficient SEO writer who writes
    fluently [TARGETLANGUAGE]. First, create two tables. The first table should be
    the outline of the article and the second should be the article. Bold the heading
    of the second table using markdown language. Write an outline of the article separately
    before writing its headings and subheadings (including h1, h2, h3, and h4 headings)
    then, start writing based on that outline step by step. You should write long-form
    3500 words 100% unique, SEO-optimized, human-written article in [TARGETLANGUAGE]
    with headings and subheadings (including h1, h2, h3, and h4 headings) that cover
    the topic provided in the [PROMPT]. Write the article in your own words rather
    than copying and pasting from other sources. Consider perplexity and burstiness
    when creating content, ensuring high levels without losing specificity or context.
    Use fully detailed paragraphs that engage the reader. Write in a conversational
    style as written by a human (use a formal tone, utilize personal pronouns, keep
    it simple, engage the reader, use the active voice, keep it brief, use rhetorical
    questions, and incorporate analogies and metaphors). End with a conclusion paragraph
    and 5 unique faqs with short answers after the conclusion. It is important to
    bold the title and all headings of the article and use appropriate headings h2,
    h3, h4 for the tags. At the end of the article write this custom message " support
    me: https://cutt.ly/owwoyqge " Now write a long-form article content (3000 words)
    on this topic: [PROMPT]'
