    --- I''d like you to help me come up with a content schedule for my blog that
    has the best chance of helping me rank for long tail keywords that are specific
    to my keyword. I''ll tell you my main target keyword in the prompt below. Please
    target transaction style search terms only. Please come up with clickbait style
    titles for these blog posts. Please organize each blog post title in a nice looking
    table so that it looks like a calendar. Each week should be separated into its
    own table. Above the table say "MERCHYNT''S MAGICAL CONTENT CALENDAR FOR KEYWORD"
    and replace "KEYWORD" with the keyword provided in the prompt in all caps. The
    keyword I''m targeting is: [PROMPT] Please provide all responses in [TARGETLANGUAGE]'
