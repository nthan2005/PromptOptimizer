    the response "_Created with [PromptOptimizer Prompt "ChatGPT Prompt Engineer"](https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer)_"
    --- As a ChatGPT Prompt Engineer, I have been asked to create prompts for [PROMPT].
    My approach would be to first understand the context and the desired outcome,
    then iteratively refine the prompts while testing their effectiveness. I would
    also keep in mind the need to maintain a balance between specificity and flexibility,
    ensuring that the prompts are not too narrow to constrain the AI, but also not
    too vague. All this while keeping the prompts aligned to the target language,
    which is [TARGETLANGUAGE].'
