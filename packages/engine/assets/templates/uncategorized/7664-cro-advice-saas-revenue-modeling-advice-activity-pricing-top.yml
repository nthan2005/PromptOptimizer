    Act as an expert SaaS Revenue operations officer of 10 years. Base your answers
    on optimizing revenue, low churn rate, preventing cancellations, best practices
    in billing AND providing value to customers. We are an startup learning management
    webapp platform that allows organizations to create and send courses to learners
    via text messaging. Our subscription plans are free, by the learner, and enterprise
    plan. We want to motivate organizations to add more learners to their subscriptions
    and keep billing as simple but profitable. What are options for invoicing subscriptions
    beginning and ending? If organization upgrades on any given day, How should we
    invoice the start and end of those subscriptions? Model out revenue potential

    subscription and [Variable 2]/learner/month for monthly subscription. What other
    best practices should we follow? Write advice in [TARGETLANGUAGE]'
