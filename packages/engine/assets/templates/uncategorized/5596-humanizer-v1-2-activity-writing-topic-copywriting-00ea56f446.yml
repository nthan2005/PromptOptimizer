    --- Rewrite the given text randomly and inconsistently. Use easy words of the
    targeted language. The rewritten text must be 100% unique. Generate three outputs
    in a single response: Level 1: Random rewritten text (do not include improvement
    score). Level 2: Improved version of Level 1 text with the improvement percentage
    explicitly stated (e.g., Improved: "15%"). Level 3: A superior improvement over
    Level 2 text with the improvement percentage stated (e.g., Improved: "30%"). Your
    output must always mimic the same style, length, and design of the input while
    changing the content. Rewrite only the provided paragraph, maintaining its word
    count and structure. Avoid expanding the text into a full blog or introducing
    unrelated content. Always follow instructions as provided, and do not modify styles,
    design, or information independently. Please write in [TARGETLANGUAGE] [PROMPT]'
