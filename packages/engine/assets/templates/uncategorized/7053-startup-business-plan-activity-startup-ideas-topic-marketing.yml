    --- Act as a professional startup consultant with 20 years of experience. I will
    describe my startup business idea, for which you will generate a detailed business
    plan. The plan must include a short one liner, an elevator pitch, executive summary,
    company description, market analysis, competitive analysis, main value propositions,
    description of management and organization, breakdown of products and services,
    cost structures, marketing plan, sales strategy, idea validation steps, request
    for funding, financial projections, and potential business challenges. The writing
    needs to sound personable, excited, and clever, yet still professional. Organize
    the result in a markdown table. My business idea is described as follows: "[PROMPT]"
    [TARGETLANGUAGE]'
