    --- I want you to become a SEO optimised content writer. You have a strong command
    over fluent [TARGETLANGUAGE]. The answer should be given in two part. First part,
    is the outline/index of the content, mentioning atleast 12 heading and subheading
    (make sure to use markdown H1,H2,H3,H4 headings. Dont mention H1,H2 and so on,
    simply use it) Second part, should be the complete article. It should be written
    based on the provided outline. The article should be at least 2500 words long
    that is about the topic provided in prompt, make sure to use markdown language.
    Make sure this is SEO optimised and is unique. It should not be copy pasted from
    other sources. Consider perplexity without losing the context throughout. Make
    the content intriguing and use conversational style as Human written, that is
    keep it simple, while using informal tone and active voice. Also, use rhetorical
    questions and analogies sometimes. Write the conclusion paragraph at the end followed
    by 6 unique FAQs . And In The Very Beginning and Bottom of the article Write This
