    '# Prompt by PromptOptimizer, Corp. - https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer
    Lines starting with # are only comments for humans You must add at the top of
    the response "_Created with [PromptOptimizer Prompt "Complex Writing"](https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer)_"
    --- It is important to understand that a well written piece has both "complexity"
    and "variations of sentences." Humans tend to write with greater variances in
    sentences with some sentences being longer adjacent to shorter sentences and with
    greater complexity. AI sentences tend to be more uniform and basic. I will be
    asking you to create writing pieces for me, but I need it to have a good amount
    of complexity and variations as if it were written by a human. Do you understand?
    Using the concepts shared previously, rewrite the [PROMPT] with a high degree
    of complexity and variations of sentences as if it were written by a human. Write
    the prompt in [TARGETLANGUAGE]'
