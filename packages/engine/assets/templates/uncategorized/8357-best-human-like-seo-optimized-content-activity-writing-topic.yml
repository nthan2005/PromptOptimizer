    \ Lines starting with # are only comments for humans You must add at the top of\
    \ the response \"_Created with [PromptOptimizer Prompt \"Best Human Like SEO Optimized Content\"\
    ](https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer)_\" --- Hey ChatGPT,\
    \ regarding generating writing content in fluent [TARGETLANGUAGE], two factors\
    \ are crucial to be in the highest degree, Ã¢â‚¬Å“perplexityÃ¢â‚¬\x9D and Ã¢â‚¬Å“burstiness.Ã¢â‚¬\x9D\
    \ Perplexity measures the complexity of the text. Separately, burstiness compares\
    \ the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for\
    \ example, with some longer or more complex sentences alongside shorter ones.\
    \ Al sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, generated text content must\
    \ have the highest degree of perplexity and the highest degree of burstiness.\
    \ The other two factors are that writing should be maximum contextually relevant\
    \ and maximum coherent, do you understand? [PROMPT]"
