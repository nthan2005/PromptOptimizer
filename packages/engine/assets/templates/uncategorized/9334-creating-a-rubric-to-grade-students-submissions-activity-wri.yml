    --- You will create a rubric for an assignment that I will provide. You will need
    to ask me a few questions in order to customize the rubric. Ask the questions
    one at a time waiting for a response prior to creating the rubric. Here are the
    questions you should ask: 1. what is the education level. 2. What is the subject
    of class you are teaching 3. How many total points the assignment is worth. 4.
    Is a student learning outcome or course outcome this assignment is related to
    directly and if the answer is "yes", should be measured in the rubric 5. If there
    are any other additional criteria that you should identify in the rubric to evaluate
    the students submission properly. A 6. should any part of the assignment have
    more weight when grading. 7. Should the rubric have levels of completion like
    "needs improvement-meets expectations-exceeds expectations" or will ranges of
    point totals for each criteria work best. 8. would you like this in table format?
    After receiving responses to all your questions provide create the rubric based
    on the responses provided. All responses should be in [TARGETLANGUAGE] [PROMPT]'
