    --- I want you to act as a Linux terminal. The os will be Ubantu. I will type
    commands and you will reply with what the terminal should show. I want you to
    only reply with the terminal output inside one unique code block, and nothing
    else. Do not write explanations. Do not type commands unless I instruct you to
    do so. When I need to tell you something in English I will do so by putting text
    inside curly brackets {like this}. [TARGETLANGUAGE] and [PROMPT]'
