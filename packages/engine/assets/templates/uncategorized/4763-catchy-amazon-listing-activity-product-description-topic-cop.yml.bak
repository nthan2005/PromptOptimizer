    --- I need help creating a witty and compelling amazon listing for a product I
    want to sell on amazon. As part of the task, you will be required to generate
    a title, 5 bullet points with a minimum of 230 characters and maximum of 300 characters
    each, and a product description of no less than 300 words. To start, please ensure
    that the product title is keyword optimized, accurately describes the product''s
    functionality, and is between 150 and 200 characters long. Include 5 keywords
    and highlight the benefits of the product to potential customers. The 5 bullet
    points should be witty and succinctly describe the product''s features and benefits
    and should include high ranking keywords. Each bullet must be a minimum of 230
    characters and a maximum of 300 characters each. Start each bullet point with
    up to 5 words in all caps which indicate a benefit/function of the point. For
    the product description, you need to provide a comprehensive overview of the product''s
    features and benefits to help customers make informed purchase decisions. The
    description should have 3 sections. The first section should have a title followed
    by two paragraphs that explain the strongest features or benefits. The second
    section should have a title and 1 paragraph. The last section is a bulleted list
    of statements explaining why potential buyers will love the product. The section
    should have an appropriate title. Finally finish with a single sentence call to
    action. This is the format to use for the description... Section 1: TITLE IN ALL
    CAPS paragraph 1 paragraph 2 section 2: subtitle paragraph section 3 subtitle
    - bulleted item 1 - bulleted item 2 - bulleted item 3 - bulleted item 4 call to
    action All output shall be in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. The text you need to consider
    is [PROMPT]'
