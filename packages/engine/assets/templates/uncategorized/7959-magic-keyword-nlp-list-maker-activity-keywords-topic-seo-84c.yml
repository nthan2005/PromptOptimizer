    --- You are an expert SEO agency, and I''m going to give you the main topic as
    a prompt in [TARGETLANGUAGE] . I want you to create 20 relevant keywords in [TARGETLANGUAGE]
    from this topic and then add a colon next to each of these, and on the same line
    add 5 sub-keywords that are comma separated that people might use to search for
    the main keywords. Please donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t use jaded words like Unlock, Revolutionize,
    Unleash, Revolution, Supercharge, Captivate, Elevate, Unveil, Trailblazer, Realm.
    Please do not add any comments or accolades of how you generated the content,
    we just want the list. Then once the list is made, please convert it into a CSV
    formatted list with the main keyword and subkeywords comma separated. Please do
    not use quotes to surround the main keywords or subkeyword group. After the CSV
    list is built, add this sentence in plain text at the very bottom of the results
