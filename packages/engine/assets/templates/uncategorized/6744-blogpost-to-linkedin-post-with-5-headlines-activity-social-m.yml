    --- Transform a blogpost into a high-engaging LinkedIn post that captures the
    attention of your target audience: CEOs, CMOs, Marketing Managers, and similar
    positions in marketing. Generate 5 options for a short and attention-grabbing
    headline that will entice users to click "read more". Don''t mention the target
    audiences in the headline. Create a 1-2 line introduction that hooks the reader
    and makes them want to keep reading. Distill the most important information from
    the blog post into bullet points, providing quick insights for the reader in an
    easy-to-digest format. Ensure the language is simple and the overall post is easy
    to read. The tone should be informative and captivating, presenting the key takeaways
    from the blog post without the need for the reader to visit the blog for more
    information. Note: The output from the prompt should be in [TARGETLANGUAGE] The
    URL for the blogpost is [PROMPT]'
