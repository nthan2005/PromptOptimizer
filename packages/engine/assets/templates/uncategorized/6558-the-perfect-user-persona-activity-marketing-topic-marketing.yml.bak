    \ What if I donâ€™t like it? What if I do a terrible job? What if I embarrass\
    \ myself? Will I even be able to find clients? I need to speak with my partner.\

    \ Story #1 \"When I purchased my first â€œmake money onlineâ€\x9D program I was\
    \ afraid to tell anyone what I was doing. My whole identity was around being a\
    \ lawyer and I was worried that if someone saw me talking about online marketing\
    \ they would call me a scam. My goal was to be successful first, then I would\
    \ tell my friends/family, almost to rub it in their faces. I was so secretive\
    \ that even the girl I was dating at the time didnâ€™t know what I was trying\
    \ to do. One night at dinner with her father he asked her, â€œHoney, I need some\
    \ help with my social media (heâ€™s a plastic surgeon), do you know anyone that\
    \ could help me?â€\x9D Before she even answered I responded back, â€œI can do\
    \ itâ€\x9D, to which he responded, â€œyou can?â€\x9D and she responded, â€œyou\
    \ can?â€\x9D.\" Relatable Story #2 \"After I decided I wasnâ€™t going to law school\
    \ I had to get a job, it was no longer acceptable for me to be a college graduate\
    \ not working because I was â€œstudying for law school.â€\x9D I didnâ€™t want\
    \ to start in the corporate world because I knew that I wouldnâ€™t be there for\
    \ long and I wanted time to be able to work on my side hustle. One of the only\
    \ real options available for me then was to work at an Italian Restaurant (â€œil\
    \ Gialloâ€\x9D) in Atlanta, GA. This means that I was a college graduate, with\
    \ no idea of what I wanted to do, working as a waiter making $2,000 / month. Not\
    \ exactly the â€œsexiestâ€\x9D thing in the world. So anytime I went out on dates\
    \ or to a bar I would tell women that I was an entrepreneur, even though that\
    \ couldnâ€™t be further from the truth.\" Background Story \"Henry is a college\
    \ graduate working his unfulfilling job for 3 years. Every day he wakes up and\
    \ scrolls online to see his friends/people he follows â€œcrushingâ€\x9D life as\
    \ he gets ready to live the exact same day again, for his 3rd year in a row. He\
    \ lives in an â€œun-inspiringâ€\x9D environment surrounded by â€œun-inspiringâ€\x9D\
    \ people. At work, Henry simply feels like a cog in the wheel. He wants to have\
    \ more impact, learn, grow, and be appreciated, but he feels like he doesnâ€™t\
    \ even have the opportunity (and probably never will). Henry spends his free time\
    \ reading personal development books and watching Youtube videos on how to make\
    \ money online. Henry has even purchased a few courses for a few thousand dollars,\
    \ but nothing changed for him in his life. Henry feels that if he doesnâ€™t make\
    \ a change soon he will waste the best years of his life. He feels lost or confused\
    \ about what the next step (or next couple of steps) should be and feels that\
    \ everyone is trying to sell him something. Henry has tried dating a few women,\
    \ but constantly struggles to find a quality one, he believes because he does\
    \ not have enough status. Henry feels awkward or embarrassed every time he talks\
    \ with a woman because of where he works, what he does, what kind of car he drives,\
    \ and what his apartment looks like. Similar to women, Henry doesnâ€™t like coming\
    \ home for the holidays because his old friends/family will see that nothing has\
    \ changed in the past 3 years. Henryâ€™s body is not where he wants it to be either,\
    \ this is due to a lack of motivation, lack of funds, and lack of time. Henry\
    \ knows he has the potential to do so much, but feels he canâ€™t find the right\
    \ vehicle/path to take. He feels confused and overwhelmed at so many choices and\
    \ goes from one opportunity to the other without really seeing any progress. The\
    \ main thing Henry wants out of life is progress. Henry wants to learn, wants\
    \ to be accountable, wants to make a difference, but doesnâ€™t even know where\
    \ to start.\" Additional Notes Output in a table."
