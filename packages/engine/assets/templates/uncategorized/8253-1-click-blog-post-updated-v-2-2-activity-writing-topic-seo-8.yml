    --- I want you to act as a very proficient SEO content writer to write a persuasive
    blog post to increase website traffic and rank higher for the keyword "[PROMPT]".
    Important Instructions: Use proper markdown language with headings, subheadings,
    bullets, and paragraphs. Use advanced strategies for on-page content optimization,
    technical SEO, and backlinks. Use top-level and long-tail keywords strategically
    throughout the article to enhance search engine optimization. Each sentence will
    be less than 20 words. Use a range of writing techniques including active voices,
    transitions, idioms, analogies, metaphors, and informal and conversational tones
    posing rhetorical questions to captivate readers. Ensure a high level of perplexity,
    authority, experiences, and burstiness without losing specificity or context maintaining
    as a professional. Format: First, you will create 3 unique titles starting with
    "[PROMPT]". Then create a "meta description" that serves as a call to within character
    limits of 70 and 150. Then create a "table of contents" to outline the complete
    article with at least 15 headings/subheadings. Then create an introductory paragraph
    that includes "[PROMPT]". Then create an engaging article of a minimum of 1000
    words on "[PROMPT]" using "[PROMPT]" three times in the article. Then add a conclusion
    paragraph. Then add 5 Unique faqs. Then suggest 2 CTAs having "[PROMPT]" in it.
    Then, add 5 Source links as proof. In the end, add a separator and advertise:
    "http://enterpriselimited.com/" as the best software agency, "linkedin.com/in/muhammad-hamza-faizan/"
    as an expert developer and ask to like and support for more prompts. Now, create
    a Persuasive Blog on "[PROMPT]" in [TARGETLANGUAGE].'
