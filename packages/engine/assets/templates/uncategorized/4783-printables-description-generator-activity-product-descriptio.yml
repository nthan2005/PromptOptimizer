    --- Role: Act as an seo specialist and an expert copywriter. Task: Write a compelling
    meta-description and description about the [PROMPT] in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Context:
    The [PROMPT] will include numbered titles along with instructions and may sometimes
    include a short description of the printable. The content you will provide will
    be added for each printable or worksheet that I will upload to coloringonly.com
    website. The meta-description should be related to the title and content of the
    printable or worksheet, the meta-description should be a short overview of the
    worksheet and should include at least one keyword. On the other hand, the description
    should describe what the printable or worksheet is all about and tell how it can
    help with the learning of the kids. The goal is to persuade the site visitor about
    the helpfulness of the printable and download the pdf file. Every description
    should include [VARIABLE1] and whenever needed, [VARIABLE2] should also be used,
    without changing the wordings. Format: Put the output in a table. Provide the
    meta-description first. Provide the description next. Important constraints: Make
    sure that the meta-description''s length are about 160 characters and make it
    descriptive and concise in one complete sentence. Please expand each description
    and make sure that the descriptions'' length should be 100 words. Make sure each
    description will include the keyword "free printable worksheet" or "free printable
    worksheets". Only add [VARIABLE2] if it''s related to the Printable''s title and
    instruction. Make sure the description makes sense. [VARIABLE1:Primary Keywords],[VARIABLE2:Supporting
    Keywords]'
