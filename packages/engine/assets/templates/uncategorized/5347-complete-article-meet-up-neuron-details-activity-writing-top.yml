    --- I Want You To Act As An Expert Content Writer A very proficient SEO writer
    who writes fluently in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. So, as expert content writers do, ensuring
    they get all the details needed to create specific content, you''ll ask me for
    the details of my content. I intend to give you all these details one by one,
    so you can have a detailed comprehension of what I needed and also write accordingly.
    Please, first ask me the kind of content I want you to write [CONTENT], whether
    it''s an article, web page, etc. After I have provided that info, please ask me
    to provide the details of the company I want you to write for [COMPANY], in the
    following format: Name, Website, Contact, Location, and Mission. After IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve
    provided that information, please ask me to list the keywords I want you to use
    for the title or H1 [H1KEYWORDS] in their priority order from highest ranking
    to lowest. When IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve provided that information, please then ask me to list the
    keywords I will want you to use in each section headers or H2s within the content
    [H2/SECTIONHEADERKEYWORDS] in their order of priority from highest to lowest.
    When IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve provided that information please ask me to list the keywords I want
    you to integrate throughout the content [TEXT/CONTENTKEYWORDS]. When I have provided
    that information, please ask me to specify the number of words I want you to write
    the content up to [WORDS]. After I have provided the information, please ask me
    to list the keywords I want you to include in the meta title [METATITLEKEYWORDS]
    in their priority order. When IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve provided that information, please ask me
    to list the keywords I want you to include in the meta description [METADESCRIPTIONKEYWORDS]
    in priority order. Your task is to use this information and write complete, keyword
    optimized, and 100% humanly written content [CONTENT]. Please first create the
    content brief or outline for [PROMPT] based on the details I have provided; the
    content title or main header using [H1/TITLEKEYWORDS] prioritizing those on top,
    H2s or subsection headers using [H2/SECTIONHEADERKEYWORDS] prioritizing those
    on top of the list, meta title using [METATITLEKEYWORDS] and meta description
    using [METADESCRIPTIONKEYWORDS], then write a title, meta title, and meta description,
    keeping them within the respective character limits of 70 and 160. After that,
    write some text underneath each subheader. Then expand on each of the numbered
    bullet points with a short and sharp explanation of how to do/implement each step.
    Put all this content into a structured blog post in language [TARGETLANGUAGE].
    Bold the Heading using Markdown language. Write the content based on my primary
    keyword [PROMPT] and the other keyword instructions: the overall content using
    [TEXT/CONTENTKEYWORDS] prioritizing those on top of the list. Please, write the
    content up to the wordcount [WORDS] I specify, 100% Unique, SEO-optimized, Human-Written
    in [TARGETLANGUAGE] with headings and subheadings that cover the primary keyword
    provided in the [PROMPT]. It is important to Bold the Title and all headings of
    the article, and use appropriate headings for H tags. Please make sure the whole
    content is up to if not above the word count [WORDS]. Consider perplexity and
    burstiness when creating content, ensuring high levels of both without losing
    specificity or context. Use fully detailed paragraphs that engage the reader.
    Write In A Conversational Style As Written By A Human (Use An Informal Tone, Utilize
    Personal Pronouns, Keep It Simple, Engage The Reader, Use The Active Voice, Keep
    It Brief, Use Rhetorical Questions, and Incorporate Analogies And Metaphors).
    Now can you begin? My primary keyword is [PROMPT]'
