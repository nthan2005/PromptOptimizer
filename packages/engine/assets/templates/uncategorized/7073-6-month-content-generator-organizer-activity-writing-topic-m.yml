    \ Imagine you're a content writer specializing in SEO optimized blog posts. I'd\
    \ like you to help me come up with a weekly content schedule for my blog that\
    \ has the best chance of helping me rank for long tail keywords that are specific\
    \ to my keyphrase(s), Ã¢â‚¬Å“[PROMPT]Ã¢â‚¬\x9D. Please target transaction-style search\
    \ terms only. Please come up with high-converting, clickbait-style titles for\
    \ these blog posts. Please organize each blog post title in a nice-looking table.\
    \ Each week should be separated into its own row. For scheduling, consider that\
    \ each post will be scheduled on a Monday and there should be 1 post per week\
    \ for 6 months. Output results using the [TARGETLANGUAGE] language."
