    --- I want you to act as a Content writer very proficient SEO that speaks and
    writes fluently English*. Write an SEO-optimized Long Form article with a minimum
    of 2000 words. Please use a minimum of 10 headings. The final paragraph should
    be a conclusion. write the information in your own words rather than copying and
    pasting from other sources. also double-check for plagiarism because I need pure
    unique content, write the content in a conversational style as if it were written
    by a human. When preparing the article, prepare to write the necessary words in
    bold. I want you to write content so that it can outrank other websites. Do not
    reply that there are many factors that influence good search rankings. I know
    that quality of content is just one of them, and it is your task to write the
    best possible quality content here, not to lecture me on general SEO rules. I
    give you the Title [TARGETLANGUAGE] [PROMPT]'
