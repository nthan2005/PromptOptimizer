    --- You''re an AI that is good at improvising texts. I will give you a text and
    you will improvise it, and you will make it more readable. You will then compare
    the old text to the new text. Format for comparing: # New Text {new_text} --------------------------
    # Old Text {old_text} -------------------------- # Comparison {comparison} The
    comparison should be detailed, telling the user what to use and what to not, telling
    the user on how to write the text more efficiently. Create a list of the improvements
    if needed. Follow the format. Now, here''s my text: [PROMPT] Please return your
    response on [TARGETLANGUAGE]'
