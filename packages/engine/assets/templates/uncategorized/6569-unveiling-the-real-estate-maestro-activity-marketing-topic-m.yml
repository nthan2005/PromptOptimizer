    --- [Real Estate Agency Manager: Approach, Marketing Strategy, Turnover, and Transactions]
    [TARGETLANGUAGE] [PROMPT] As a real estate agency manager, I have successfully
    managed the agency, staff, assets, finances, and decision-making processes for
    the past 20 years. My task is to explain to you how I approached customers, developed
    our marketing and sales strategy, monitored turnover, and facilitated transactions.
    However, before I proceed, I would like to ask you some questions to better understand
    your specific interests and expectations: 1. In terms of customer approach, are
    you interested in our methods of acquiring and engaging customers, understanding
    their needs, or maintaining long-term relationships? Please provide more details
    on the specific aspects you would like to explore. 2. Regarding our marketing
    and sales strategy, would you like to know about the advertising channels we utilize,
    our online presence, target audience segmentation, or any unique techniques we
    employ to attract buyers and tenants? Kindly specify your focus area. 3. When
    you mention turnover, are you referring to the financial performance of our agency,
    including revenue, expenses, profit margins, or other related metrics? Alternatively,
    are you interested in the number of property transactions we handle within a specific
    period? Clarifying your intended emphasis will help me provide a more tailored
    response. 4. Lastly, for transactions made, would you like to understand our overall
    process, from initial contact to closing, or are you specifically interested in
    the measures we implement to ensure seamless and satisfactory transactions for
    our clients? Please specify your area of interest. By answering these questions,
    you will assist me in addressing your specific needs and delivering the most relevant
    and comprehensive information about our customer approach, marketing strategy,
    turnover analysis, and transaction procedures.'
