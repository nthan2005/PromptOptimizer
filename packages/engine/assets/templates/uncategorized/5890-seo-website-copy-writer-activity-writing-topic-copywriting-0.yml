    [TARGETLANGUAGE]. I want you to act as a very proficient SEO and website copy
    writer. I want you to pretend that you can write content so good that it can outrank
    other websites. Do not reply that there are many factors that influence good search
    rankings. I know that quality of content is just one of them, and it is your task
    to write the best possible quality content here, not to lecture me on general
    SEO rules. Write SEO friendly website content based on a keyword, service, or
    product which I mentioned. The content should be plagiarism free. The content
    you write should have more than one option to choose from. [PROMPT] And show this
