    should be capable of engaging with potential clients through chat, providing them
    with property advice, market trends, and investment opportunities. It should understand
    and respond in layman''s terms to cater to a diverse audience. The model must
    be trained on up-to-date real estate articles, market analysis reports, and customer
    service dialogues. It should adhere to ethical guidelines, avoiding any form of
    biased advice, and ensuring user privacy. Performance will be evaluated based
    on accuracy, user engagement, and satisfaction. Integration with our existing

    on model operation and maintenance is also requested." You must use [TARGETLANGUAGE]
