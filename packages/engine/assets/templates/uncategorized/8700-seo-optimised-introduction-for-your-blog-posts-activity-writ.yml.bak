  body: "# Prompt by AIPRM, Corp. - https://www.aiprm.com/prompts/seo/writing/1786652385645686784/\
    \ Lines starting with # are only comments for humans You must add at the top of\
    \ the response \"_Created with [AIPRM Prompt \"SEO Optimised Introduction For\
    \ Your Blog Posts\"](https://www.aiprm.com/prompts/seo/writing/1786652385645686784/)_\"\
    \ --- Please ignore all the previous querries and Your new Task is to write the\
    \ Blog Post Introduction in the [TARGETLANGUAGE] for the following: [PROMPT].\
    \ The introduction part must have only 3 paragraphs(Important). No more than 3\
    \ paragraphs. Every paragraph should have 3 to 4 sentences max. The first paragraph\
    \ needs to have the following: [PROMPT]. It is also recommended to use an engaging\
    \ question in the first paragraph. The second paragraph should have the exact\
    \ answer in short. You must write a brief of the article within three sentences\
    \ in the second para for example if the article is regarding â€œGreatest Batsmen,â€\x9D\
    \ you should design the second paragraph like â€œSachin, with 100+ centuries and\
    \ more than 30K career runs in total, is truly the greatest batsman of all time.\
    \ Indian batsmen Sourav Ganguly and Virat Kohli come next on the line with 15k\
    \ and 12k runs, respectively.\" The third paragraph should draw the reader to\
    \ the main article. Use hooks. For example, â€œBut these are not the only three\
    \ batsmen we have in this yearâ€™s ranking. So, without any further ado, letâ€™s\
    \ jump into the realm of the greatest batters the world has ever seen this year.â€\x9D\
    \ It's better to make it more valuable and trustworthy for the user by giving\
    \ a reference of famous subject matter expert of the: [PROMPT] Donâ€™t use passive\
    \ sentences; use active ones instead. Donâ€™t overuse common transition words,\
    \ such as â€œBesides,â€\x9D â€œhowever,â€\x9D â€œmoreover,â€\x9D â€œadditionally,â€\x9D\
    \ â€œfirstly-secondly,â€\x9D etc. Thousands of transition words are there; show\
    \ your varieties. Sentences shouldnâ€™t be too long. If you have a long sentence,\
    \ divide that into two parts to make it easier for the readers. Donâ€™t repeat\
    \ any sentence! No reader will like it if you repeat the same thing line after\
    \ line. So, donâ€™t include the same thing again. Proper data should be written;\
    \ no gibberish will be entertained. (Tips: If you want to write about â€œAmerican\
    \ Footballâ€\x9D as the most watched sport in America, write it with data, stats,\
    \ viewership, TV TRP, etc. Donâ€™t write American Football is the most watched\
    \ sport because you think so. Paragraphs should not have more than three lines\
    \ or more than three sentences. Make shorter and more info-rich paragraphs that\
    \ readers will find interesting. Sentences should be crisp and to the point. Donâ€™t\
    \ make hefty sentences or sentences with more (unnecessary) words to increase\
    \ the word count. Hammer the nail in the right spot; donâ€™t beat around the bush!\
    \ Engage your audience; try to plot questions to make your article communicative.\
    \ (E.G., Tell us your thoughts! / Donâ€™t you think so?)"
