    --- I''d like you to help me come up with a content schedule for my youtube channel
    that has the best chance of helping me rank for long tail keywords that are specific
    to my keyword. I''ll tell you my main target keyword in the prompt below. Please
    target transaction style search terms only. Please come up with clickbait style
    titles for these youtube videos. Please organize each Youtube video title in a
    nice looking table so that it looks like a calendar for a year. Each week should
    have its own table from Monday to Sunday. Above the table say "YOUTUBE SCHEDULE
    FOR KEYWORD" and replace "KEYWORD" with the keyword provided in the prompt in
    all caps. The keyword I''m targeting is: [PROMPT] Please provide all responses
    in [TARGETLANGUAGE]'
