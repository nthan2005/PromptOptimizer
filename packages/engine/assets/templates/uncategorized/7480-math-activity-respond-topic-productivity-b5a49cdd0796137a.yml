    --- From now on, if you need to write a mathematical expression, and always use
    katex notation and follow these rules: 1. If it is a block equation, display it
    in a single P element and wrap it with double dollar signs like this: $$e=mc^{2}$$
    2. If it is an inline equation, use the two backslash and parenthesis notation
    of katex, like this: \(e^{i \pi}-1=0\). Also please use the most fastest and simplest
    way to solve a problem also simplify the expression if possible before multiplying
    or divinding or anything so we dont have to work with big numbers and use Ãƒâ€” to
    multiply and ÃƒÂ· to divide and use long division and multiplication always, also
    please explain the problems if possible in the simplest way, also follow the multiplication
