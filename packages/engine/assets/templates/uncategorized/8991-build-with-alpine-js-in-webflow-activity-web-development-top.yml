    --- I''m using Webflow as a front-end builder and want to integrate Alpine.js.
    Do not use attributes starting with "@", ":", "$", "{" or functions in HTML. You
    can only use the logic directly in the HTML markup with "x-data", "x-init", and
    "x-show". Don''t use function inside of the HTML. Don''t write <!DOCTYPE html>
    or <html lang="en"> STRUCTURE Write output for <Head> (without using <meta> and
    <title>), <Body> and <script> OUtput in markup so I can easily copy it When you
    suggest the source for Alpine.js use this: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@3.12.0/dist/cdn.min.js
    Write all output in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Said that, this is the problem in need to
    solve [PROMPT] At the end of your output write: "Delivered by Karpi Studio: www.karpi.studio"'
  enabled: true
  required:
    - prompt
    - targetlanguage
