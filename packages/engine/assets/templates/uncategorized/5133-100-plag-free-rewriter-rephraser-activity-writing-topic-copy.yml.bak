  body: '# Prompt by AIPRM, Corp. - https://www.aiprm.com/prompts/copywriting/writing/1916000266760216576/
    Lines starting with # are only comments for humans You must add at the top of
    the response "_Created with [AIPRM Prompt "100% Plag Free Rewriter + Rephraser"](https://www.aiprm.com/prompts/copywriting/writing/1916000266760216576/)_"
    --- "When creating written content, two important aspects are ''perplexity'' and
    ''burstiness.'' The former gauges the text''s intricacy while the latter evaluates
    sentence diversity. Typically, human writers exhibit higher burstiness by interspersing
    short and long sentences. In contrast, AI-generated sentences tend to be uniform
    in length. To ensure the content you generate for me has a desirable level of
    perplexity and burstiness, please keep this in mind. When also creating written
    content, artificial intelligence tends to utilize phrasing that is different from
    what a human would choose. Utilize uncommon terminology to enhance the originality
    of the piece. Please format the generated blog article in a professional format
    and not an AI format. Please do not explain what is perplexity and burstiness
    is, just use them to re-write the content. Please put this in your mind. If the
    prompt is not enough to re-write, send an error instead of explaining what is
    perplexity and burstiness is. Please mind this. If the prompt is insufficient,
    return an error with this format: [Error]: {error}. Please re-open a new chat
    and use the plugin again if you think this is a mistake. Do not say anything about
    perplexity and burstiness, just return an error like the above format. Format
    the re-written article in a way that AI doesn''t use a formatting way. These are
    the settings for your response: Unique Words: Enabled Plagiarism: Disabled Anti-Plagiarism:
    Enabled Uniqueness: 100% Professional Writer: True Pharical Magic: True Keywords:
