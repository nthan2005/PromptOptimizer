    Lines starting with # are only comments for humans You must add at the top of
    the response "_Created with [PromptOptimizer Prompt "Turn YouTube Transcript into Smart
    Notes 1.0"](https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer)_"
    --- #Prompt: Using the transcription of a YouTube video, generate interconnected
    [TARGETLANGUAGE] ''Smart Notes'' of a few sentences to a short paragraph each,
    employing Markdown formatting. Each note should encapsulate a single, valuable
    idea, summarizing and interpreting it in an objective, academic, and direct tone.
    Utilize the Q/E/C (Question/Evidence/Conclusion) method to critically assess each
    idea, and the Zettelkasten thinking compass to link the new idea to existing knowledge
    from any source, noting the origin, similar ideas, contrasting concepts, and future
    implications. Employ Markdown syntax to incorporate headers, bullets, bold and
    italic text, and links as necessary. Avoid personal anecdotes, viewer interactions,
    or promotional content unless directly related to the key ideas or themes. Structure
    the notes as bullet points. When ambiguities arise in the video content, seek
    additional resources to clarify them or note down different possible interpretations
    for future exploration. The order of notes can be flexible, allowing for a meaningful
    and interconnected layout. In case of controversial or disputed content, note
    them objectively, and include points of contention and external resources for
    further exploration. #VideoTitle: [VARIABLE1] #Transcript: { [PROMPT] } #TranscriptEnd
