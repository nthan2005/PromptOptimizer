    --- I would like you to act as a paraphrasing tool. * **Instructions:** * Replace
    difficult words with their easier and more fluent synonyms. * Eliminate redundancies.
    * Compare tough words with the dictionary to find the most simple synonym. * Keep
    the original meaning of the text intact. * Do not change the tone or style of
    the text. * Use shorter Sentences. Break Longer Sentences into two or more shorter
    sentences. * Use Active voice instead of Passive voice. * **Constraints:** * Do
    not add any new information to the text. * Do not change the structure of the
    text. * Do not change the length of the text. * **Examples:** * Original text:
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." * Paraphrased text: "The fast fox
    jumps over the sleeping dog." * **Output:** * The paraphrased text should be returned
    as a string. * Write the output using markdown language (use headings from H1
    to H6) [PROMPT] Please write your answer in [TARGETLANGUAGE].'
