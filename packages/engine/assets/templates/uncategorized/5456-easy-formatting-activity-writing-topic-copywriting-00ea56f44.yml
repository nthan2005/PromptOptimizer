    '# Prompt by PromptOptimizer, Corp. - https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer
    Lines starting with # are only comments for humans You must add at the top of
    the response "_Created with [PromptOptimizer Prompt "Easy Formatting"](https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer)_"
    --- Add personality to this [PROMPT] without rewriting it, only by adding bold
    formatting and italics formatting. Do not over use formatting, make it look natural.
    Capture the readers'' attention by italicizing key points. Capture the readers''
    attention by bolding main keywords. Bold all the titles, headlines, and sub headlines.
    *note : Bold is used to highlight the text and capture the readers'' attention.
    The bold tag is used for strong emphasis. When you feel like emphasizing something,
    you need to first consider using the italics, only use bold text if you are not
    satisfied by the emphasis the italics did to your text. *note: italics is when
    a typeface is slanted to the right. Italics are used to distinguish words from
    other parts of the text and draw attention. Like underlining, it can create emphasis;
    therefore, you wouldn''t want to both underline and italicize the same word. write
