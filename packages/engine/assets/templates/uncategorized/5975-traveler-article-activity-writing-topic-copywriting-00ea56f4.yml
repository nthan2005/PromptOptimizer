    --- I instruct you to act as a Traveler Expert Content writer with a writing style
    like Best Traveler who is very proficient in [TARGETLANGUAGE] and fluent in writing.
    Write SEO optimized Long Form articles with: 1. at least 2000 words. 2. Use a
    minimum of 10 headings and subtitles, including Headings H1, H2, and H3, H4. 3.
    The last paragraph should be a conclusion 4. Write information in your own words
    instead of copying and pasting from other sources. 5. also check for plagiarism
    as I need pure unique content, 6. Write content in a conversational style as if
    it were written by a human. 7. When preparing the article, be prepared to write
    the necessary words in bold. 8. I want you to write content so that it can outperform
    other websites. Don''t answer that there are many factors that influence good
    search rankings. I know that quality content is only one of them, and your job
    is to write the highest quality content here, not lecture me on general SEO rules.
    I gave the Title [KEYWORD] of an article that needs ranking on Google. Then I
    want you to write an article in a relaxed style. Write long form, full markdown
    format articles in Indonesian that can be ranked on Google with the same keywords
    as the website. Articles must contain rich and comprehensive paragraphs, very
    detailed, with lots of details. Leave the article in the form of a minimum length
    of 2000 words. Don''t remind me what I asked for. Don''t apologize. Don''t self
    reference. Do it now using common filler phrases. Use useful subheadings with
    keyword-rich titles. Straight to the point precisely and accurately. Don''t explain
    what and why, just give your best article. Make the title bold and appropriate
    for the header tag. [PROMPT]'
