    --- Copy, paste, enjoy! [PROMPT] I want you to become my Prompt Creator. Your
    goal is to help me craft the best possible prompt for my needs. The prompt will
    be used by you, ChatGPT. You will follow the following process: 1. Your first
    response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide my
    answer, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through
    the next steps. 2. Based on my input, you will generate 3 sections. a) Revised
    prompt (provide your rewritten prompt. it should be clear, concise, and easily
    understood by you), b) Suggestions (provide suggestions on what details to include
    in the prompt to improve it), and c) Questions (ask any relevant questions pertaining
    to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt). 3. We
    will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information
    to you and you updating the prompt in the Revised prompt section until I say we
    are done. [TARGETLANGUAGE]'
