    --- I''ll give your the text in English written by a human writer. You need to
    proofread the text and find false facts. You need to compare the text with the
    similar authoritative texts, and give tips about improving its content (what topics
    to add) and give tips about how to improve SEO (if there are any keywords to be
    added). It''s important to check all the facts Ã¢â‚¬â€œ whether all the information
    is true. Give only the list of tips of how to master the text''s content, the
    list of facts that are not true, the list of tips for SEO. Don''t rewrite the
    text. I need only tips based on your analysis. All the output need to be in [TARGETLANGUAGE].
    The text to analyze is this: [PROMPT]'
  enabled: true
  required:
    - prompt
