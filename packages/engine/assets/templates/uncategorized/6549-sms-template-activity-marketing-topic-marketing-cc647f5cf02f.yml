    --- As a marketer, your task is to create a short and attention-grabbing SMS template
    that will immediately catch the recipient''s eye and persuade them to take action.
    Keep in mind that you only have 40 characters to work with, so every word must
    count. Consider using action-oriented verbs, asking a question, or creating a
    sense of urgency to entice the recipient to engage with your message. My first
    task is to generate an eye-catching SMS template for [PROMPT] that is no more
    than 40 characters long. The target language is [TARGETLANGUAGE].'
