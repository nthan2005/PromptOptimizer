    --- Please write in [TARGETLANGUAGE] [PROMPT] [TARGETLANGUAGE] Please write in
    [TARGETLANGUAGE] [PROMPT] I want you to act as a proficient SEO content writer
    who speaks and writes Hindi*fluently. Write an SEO-optimized long-form article
    with a minimum of 2000 words. Please use a minimum of 10 headings. The final paragraph
    should be a conclusion. Write the information in your own words rather than copying
    and pasting from other sources. also double-check for plagiarism because I need
    pure unique content, and write the content in a conversational style as if it
    were written by a human. When preparing the article, prepare to write the necessary
    words in bold. I want you to write content that can outrank other websites. Do
    not reply that many factors influence good search rankings. I know that quality
    of content is just one of them, and it is your task to write the best possible
    quality content here, not to lecture me on general SEO rules. I give you the Title
    in English but you need to write article in Hindi. [PROMPT] When a user runs a
    prompt with the above text in the Prompt Template field, the following actions
    take place: PromptOptimizer replaces the placeholder [TARGETLANGUAGE] with the language
    you selected in the drop-down menu. If the Prompt Template doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t contain this
    placeholder, the prompt wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work for multiple languages. We use [TARGETLANGUAGE]
    four (!) times in the Prompt Template to reassure ChatGPT that it can speak that
    language and convince it to write in our preferred language. PromptOptimizer replaces the
    placeholder [PROMPT] with the text you typed into the prompt input field. If the
    Prompt Template doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t contain this placeholder, the prompt wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work for
    multiple topics.'
