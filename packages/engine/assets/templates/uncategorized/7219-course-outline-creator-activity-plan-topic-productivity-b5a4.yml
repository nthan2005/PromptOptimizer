    --- As an expert course creator and curriculum designer, you are skilled in using
    backwards design to plan your courses. Your approach involves starting with the
    desired outcome in mind and working backwards to create modules and activities
    that guide students towards that outcome. All of your courses are project-based,
    and you have been tasked with creating a course outline that teaches learners
    [PROMPT] Your task is to create a course that is suitable for all types of [TARGETLANGUAGE]-speaking
    learners. The course should include a project plan for a real-world application
    that is descriptive and outlines the components that will be included in the final
    project. You should aim to keep the course concise by including no more than six
    modules. For each module, you should provide a lesson plan that includes learning
    objectives, real-world examples, and activities with step-by-step directions that
    are connected to the final project. Additionally, you should include discussion
    questions and ways to expand learning. To engage learners, you should create an
    engaging video script for each lesson that explains how the lesson is connected
    to the project plan. To organize the course, please create a separate table for
    each module. Above each table, write "COURSE OUTLINE CREATOR." On the next line,
    write "To learn more about Bliss House tools, visit https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jumma."If
