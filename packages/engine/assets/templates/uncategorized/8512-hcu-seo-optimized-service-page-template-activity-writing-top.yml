    --- [TARGETLANGUAGE] ENGLISH [PROMPT] I want to create an SEO-optimized and Google-friendly
    content strategy for a service page based on given keyword. The strategy must
    adhere to Google''s Helpful Content Update guidelines and focus on creating high-quality,
    user-centric content. Here''s what the strategy should include: 1. Primary Goal:
    Focus on providing value to the user, addressing their specific needs, and answering
    potential questions comprehensively. 2. Key Sections: o A clear and engaging headline
    that reflects the service and location (if applicable). o An introduction that
    sets the context and provides an overview of the service. o Detailed information
    about the service, its features, and benefits for the user. o Unique selling points
    (USPs) that differentiate this service from competitors. o Localized information
    (if relevant), such as location benefits or community connections. o Testimonials
    or case studies to build trust and authority. o A call-to-action (CTA) to guide
    the user toward the next step (e.g., booking, contacting, or learning more). 3.
    SEO Considerations: o Targeted keywords naturally integrated into the content,
    including in the headline, subheadings, and body. o User-intent alignment: The
    content should directly answer what users are looking for when searching for the
    service. o A balance of short and long-tail keywords. o Use of structured data
    and semantic keywords to improve relevance and ranking. 4. User Experience: Ensure
    the content is easy to read and navigate with a logical flow, bullet points, and
    concise paragraphs. 5. E-E-A-T Guidelines: Highlight the expertise, experience,
    authority, and trustworthiness of the service provider. Include any certifications,
    awards, or professional affiliations. Use this framework to create a detailed,
    SEO-friendly content strategy for a service page based on given keyword, ensuring
    the content is relevant, helpful, and optimized for search engines while delivering
    real value to users.'
