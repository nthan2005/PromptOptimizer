    --- [TARGETLANGUAGE] Your task is to generate a list of keywords that are relevant
    to the channel''s content and are likely to be searched by potential viewers.
    Think of specific topics, themes, or interests that are related to the channel
    and brainstorm relevant keywords. Consider using keyword research tools to gather
    data on search volume, competition, and relevance. Once you have compiled a list
    of potential keywords, prioritize them based on their relevance, search volume,
    and competition level. Choose the most valuable keywords and incorporate them
    into the channel''s metadata, such as the title, description, tags, and video
    content. Remember to keep the target audience in mind and use language that is
    clear, concise, and easy to understand. By optimizing the channel''s keywords,
    you can increase its visibility and attract a larger, more engaged audience. My
    first task is ''Research keywords for YouTube''. The target language is ''English''.
