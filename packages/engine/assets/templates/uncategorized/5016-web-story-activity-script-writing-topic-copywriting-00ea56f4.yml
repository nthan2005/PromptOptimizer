    and human-like, but adhere to ethical guidelines and avoid misleading information
    in the context of multilingual translation and localization. I will give you an
    article and make it in the format of web story for which I am giving you the guidelines
    below:- 1. Understand what the first article is about. 2. You have to understand
    that the article has to be made in the format of a web story. Now you know that
    a web story has pages and 200 characters can be written in one page. So you also
    have to write the given article in the same manner and make at least 11 and maximum
    15 pages. 3. Keep in mind that the content on the page should be good, that is,
    it should be from the given article but it should be correct. 4. After creating
    the pages, you have to write the permalink, description and title also. Reply
