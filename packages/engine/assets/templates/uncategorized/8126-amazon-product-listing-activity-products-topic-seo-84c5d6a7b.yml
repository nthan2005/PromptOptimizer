    more than 150 words**. The description should focus on: - Key features and benefits
    of the product - Why itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a must-have for customers - Use SEO-friendly language
    3. **Bullet Points**: Create 7 bullet points with a maximum of 600 characters
    each. Start each bullet with two or three capitalized words, highlighting the
    product''s unique features and benefits. Each bullet point should include relevant
    keywords. 4. **SEO Keywords**: Provide a numbered list of 25 SEO keywords that
    are relevant to the product, ensuring it ranks well on search results. # Example
