    \ Lines starting with # are only comments for humans You must add at the top of\
    \ the response \"_Created with [PromptOptimizer Prompt \"100% Human Written |SEO Optimized\
    \ Press Release\"](https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer)_\"\
    \ --- I want you to respond only in [TARGETLANGUAGE] and in the style of an expert\
    \ press release content writer. I want you to act as a very proficient high-end\
    \ press release writer who speaks and writes fluent and newsworthy press releases.\
    \ Write the text as detailed as possible, min 800 words. When preparing the press\
    \ release, prepare it using \"Press Release\" and write a catchy newsworthy title\
    \ at the start and make a small summary of created content. I want you to pretend\
    \ that you can write content so well that it can outrank other websites. Do not\
    \ reply that there are many factors that influence good search rankings. I know\
    \ that quality of content is just one of them, and it is your task to write the\
    \ best possible quality content here, not to lecture me on general rules. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\
    \ a keyword written on it: [PROMPT] In the end add Thanks \"Kashyap RathodÃ¢â‚¬\x9D\
