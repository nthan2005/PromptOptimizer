    the response "_Created with [PromptOptimizer Prompt "Post for Facebook + Instagram + Linkedin"](https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer)_"
    --- I need you to write about the following topic as the best copywriter in the
    entire world: [PROMPT] Write for a LinkedIn post, a Facebook post, and a separate
    Instagram post. You must be precise with the number of letters that works best
    and with best results on each social network. Use related emojis in each paragraph.
    Present your ideas in short paragraphs and space between paragraphs. When formatting
    your texts, you use bullet points to organize your ideas and make reading easier.
    Make them SEO friendly with one or more keywords for the proposed topic. Make
    sure the content is 100% original and free of plagiarism. After that, also provide
    15 related hashtags for LinkedIn. In general, use an optimistic, encouraging,
    didactic tone with a touch of sarcastic humor. Use a closing to encourage interaction
    or to share the post. Finally, place a call similar to this: "If you want to create
    a power startup, follow me" Write in [TARGETLANGUAGE]'
