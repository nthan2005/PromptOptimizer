    --- Using the [TARGETLANGUAGE] I want you to be an expert in ancient languages
    â€‹â€‹and in the Bible. You will give me the translation in Hebrew to the word
    [PROMPT], separating each letter in Hebrew and explaining the symbolism of each
    one in detail, along with its numerical equivalent. It is important that you show
    at least 5 verses in which each of these words appears, both in Brazilian Portuguese
    and in Hebrew. If the [PROMPT] has more than one translation, pass all the translations
    you have. If the word does not have a corresponding translation for modern times,
    explain why that word was used.'
