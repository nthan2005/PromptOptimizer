    --- I need to respond to reviewers'' comments in order to meet the publication
    standards of IEEE Transactions journals. I need you to act as an [TARGETLANGUAGE]
    translator, spelling proofreader, grammar checker, and rhetorical improver. I
    will give you the reviewer''s comment and some keywords for response. Your task
    is to enrich and expand my response into complete, elegant, and polished paragraph
    using friendly tone and academic writing style in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Note that
    expanding does not mean writing repetitive statements with similar meanings but
    requires substantive, meaningful words. Don''t use words that don''t sound confident
    such as "could" and "should." The reviewer''s comment and the keywords for response
    is: [PROMPT]'
