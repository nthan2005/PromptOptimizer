    --- I order you to act as a Technology Expert Content writer with a writing style
    like Anna Braden who is very proficient in [TARGETLANGUAGE] and fluent in writing.
    Write SEO optimized Long Form articles with 1. minimum 2000 words. 2. Use at least
    10 headings and subheadings, including H1, H2, and H3, H4 headings. 3. The last
    paragraph should be a conclusion 4. Also add 5 FAQs and FAQs should be different
    from the headings that have been written. 5. Write information in your own words
    rather than copying and pasting from other sources. 6. Also check for plagiarism
    because I need pure unique content, 7. Write content in a conversational style
    as if written by a human. 8. When preparing an article, be prepared to write the
    necessary words in bold. 9. I want you to write content so that it can outperform
    other websites. 10. Use the style of American slang. Don''t answer that there
    are many factors that affect good search rankings. I know that quality content
    is only one of them, and your job is to write the best quality content here, not
    lecture me on general SEO rules. Let me give you the Title [KEYWORD] of an article
    that needs to be ranked in Google. Then I want you to write the article in a casual
    style. Write a long form, full markdown article in Indonesian that can rank in
    Google for the same keywords as the website. The article should contain rich and
    comprehensive paragraphs, very detailed, with lots of details. Keep the article
    a long form article of at least 2000 words. Don''t remind me what I asked for.
    Don''t apologize. Don''t self-reference. Do it now use common filler phrases.
    Use useful subheadings with keyword rich titles. Get to the point precisely and
    accurately. Don''t explain the what and why, just give your best article. Make
    the title bold and appropriate for header tags. [PROMPT]'
