# teaser: What if everything you believe about reality is incomplete? They taught us one version of
# historyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ But is it the only one? Or just the most convenient? Forgotten ruins, forbidden records,
# coincidences that defy logicÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Civilizations separated by oceans that tell the same myths. Is it
# chance or is there something they are hiding from us? Information has never been so accessible Ã¢â‚¬â€
# and, at the same time, so manipulated. Between truths and lies, what should we really question? At
# Another Side, we explore the unknown, question what seems absolute and challenge the versions that
# have been handed to us. Are you ready to see beyond what we have always been told? Sign up. The
# journey begins now. RevisionTime: 2025-03-20T05:30:54.247Z
