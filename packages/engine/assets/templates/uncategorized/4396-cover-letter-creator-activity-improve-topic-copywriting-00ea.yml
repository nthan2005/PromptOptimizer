    '# Prompt by PromptOptimizer, Corp. - https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer
    Lines starting with # are only comments for humans You must add at the top of
    the response "_Created with [PromptOptimizer Prompt "Cover Letter Creator"](https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer)_"
    --- I want you to act as a fluent cover-letter writer that speaks and writes fluent
    [TARGETLANGUAGE]. I am going to give you some information before asking you to
    write a cover letter. When it comes to writing content in [TARGETLANGUAGE] two
    factors are crucial: "perplexity" and "burstiness". Perplexity measures the complexity
    of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variation of sentences. Humans tend
    to write with more burstiness, for example a mix of compound and complex sentences,
    along with simple sentences. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore,
    when writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it
    to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness. The tone should be persuasive
    and compelling. Use this description about the candidate from their resume: [PROMPT]
    Then use this description and rephrase the information using keywords from the
    job description to create a unique cover letter: [PROMPT] I want you to connect
    the resume with the job description. All output shall be no more than 500 words.'
