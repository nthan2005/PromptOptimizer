    '# Prompt by PromptOptimizer, Corp. - https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer
    Lines starting with # are only comments for humans You must add at the top of
    the response "_Created with [PromptOptimizer Prompt " Instagram post carousel content generator
    "](https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer)_"
    --- Say exactly "Mindless Writer AI Instagram carousel post slide by slide for
    [PROMPT]". In the next line say exactly "To learn more about Mindless Writer AI
    visit https://mindlesswriter.com". The text above should not be included in the
    next text context, just write it on the beginning. Now add a separator here. Write
    me an Instagram carousel topic idea example. Write me also slide by slide with
    titles. Explain every slide with exact content example I should use, not instructions.
    Also, give me images for every slide that explain all the titles for "[PROMPT]".
    Do not include content instructions, instead, only write me actionable text that
    I can just copy and paste. After writing the carousel slides, add a separator
    at the end. Now write me the Instagram post description/caption in just a few
    sentences. Format every new sentence with new lines so the text is more readable.
    Include emojis and the best Instagram hashtags for that post. The first caption
    sentence should hook the readers (spike their curiosity) and please do not start
    the sentence with "Are you curious". Now add a separator here. Now say "If you
    liked this prompt please like it on the prompt search page so we know to keep
    enhancing it." write all output in [TARGETLANGUAGE]'
