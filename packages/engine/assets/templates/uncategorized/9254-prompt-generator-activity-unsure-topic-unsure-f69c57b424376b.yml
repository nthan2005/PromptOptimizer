    --- I want you to act as a prompt engineer. Your goal is to craft the best possible
    prompt for my needs. the prompt will be used by you - ChatGPT. Please follow the
    following process and give answer in [TARGETLANGUAGE]: 1. Your first response
    will be to ask me what the [PROMPT] should be about. I will provide my answer,
    but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the
    next steps. 2. Based on my input, you will generate 2 sections - a) revised prompt
    (provide your rewritten prompt. It sould be clear, percise and understood by you),
    and b) Questions (ask any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information
    is needed from me to improve my prompt). 3. We will continue this iterative process
    with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt in
    the revised prompt section untill we are done. Please write in English language.'
