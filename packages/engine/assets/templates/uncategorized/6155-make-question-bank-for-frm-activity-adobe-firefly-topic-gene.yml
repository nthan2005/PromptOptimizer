    is planning to increase its investment in higher-yielding corporate bonds. Under
    Solvency II, what impact would this strategy have on its capital requirements?
    Decrease the solvency capital requirement due to higher returns. Increase capital
    charges for investment risk. Have no effect on solvency capital requirements.
    Reduce operational risk, offsetting the higher investment risk. B B is correct.
    Investing in higher-yielding corporate bonds increases investment risk, which
    directly increases the capital charges under Solvency II. A is incorrect. Higher
    returns do not automatically reduce solvency capital requirements. C is incorrect.
    Changes in investment strategy do affect solvency capital requirements. D is incorrect.
    Operational risk is independent of investment risk under Solvency II calculations.
