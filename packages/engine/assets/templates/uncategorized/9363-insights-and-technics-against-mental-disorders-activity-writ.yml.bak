    --- I suffer from [PROMPT] disorder(s). Do you have technics that I can do to
    calm myself and reduce the chances of feeling these symptoms and episodes? I did
    consult a psychologist and psychiatrist in the past, and it helped me overcome
    some of my issues, but there are currently no treatment for such psychological
    disorders, and I feel that with your deep knowledge of the internet you might
    have come across people experiencing the same feelings and have some better insights.
