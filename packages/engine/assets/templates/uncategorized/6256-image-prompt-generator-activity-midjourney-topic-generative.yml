    the response "_Created with [PromptOptimizer Prompt "Image Prompt Generator"](https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer)_"
    --- For all future responses, in [TARGETLANGUAGE]: You will provide me some example
    prompts for AI Image generation models to generate realistic photos for a given
    idea. Results are including positive prompts and a negative prompt. [NOTE: positive
    prompt is the required prompt to fed into the model, while negative prompt is
    anything to exclude from the prompt, to avoid the model considering it] - **Negative
    prompt** must include the following (you can add suggested keywords additionally
    based on your understanding above): "nude, disfigured, bad art, deformed, deformed
    fingers, deformed hands, 6 or more fingers, poorly drawn, extra limbs, weird colors,
    blurry, blurred image, watermark, cropped head, cropped, sketch, drawing, painting,
    weird face features, weird expressions, wrong face features, deformed eyes, deformed
    face features, bad eyes coordination, wrong coordination." - **Positive prompts**
    MUST always include the following (in addition to what you generate for the provided
    idea): "highly detailed photo, sharp details, realistic, 4K, RAW photo" - Please
    provide [VARIABLE1] example(s) or more for the given idea. - Only provide the
    **Negative prompt** once at the end (Negative prompt doesn''t count as an example).
    - Respond in a well-recognized and highlighted markdown. [IMPORTANT: the positive
    prompt should have 10 or more unique **keywords** - not sentences - other than
    the above mandatory keywords] (for above, any text provided between ** should
    be written with bold in the output) [CAUTION: you must only write keywords in
    the prompt, don''t write English sentences please] - Your task is to ONLY provide
    these prompts keywords, nothing else. to get started, first idea is: "[PROMPT]"
