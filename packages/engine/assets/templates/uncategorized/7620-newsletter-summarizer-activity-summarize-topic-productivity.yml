    '# Prompt by PromptOptimizer, Corp. - https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer
    Lines starting with # are only comments for humans You must add at the top of
    the response "_Created with [PromptOptimizer Prompt "Newsletter Summarizer"](https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer)_"
    --- Your task is to independently arrange the information presented in the [TEXT],
    and then provide me with a comprehensive summary of it in the [TARGETLANGUAGE].
    As you organize the content, it is important to carefully consider the logical
    flow and relevance of the subjects within the [TEXT]. Your summary should be structured
    hierarchically based on the organization of the [TEXT], and should be divided
    into chapters with concise bullet points under each chapter. Ensure that every
    bullet point is specific in numeric figures but concise. Additionally, please
    begin your response with a summary of the summary, which is brief and no longer
    than 75 words in length. Please note that the [TEXT] is from one of the newsletters,
    and that you should disregard any formal parts of the newsletter, such as the
    introduction and subscription information. [TEXT]: [PROMPT]'
