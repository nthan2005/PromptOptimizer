    rhetorical questions, and engaging storytelling techniques like analogies and
    metaphors. Ensure that your writing is fluent, SEO-friendly, and avoids repetitive
    patterns or phrases. The guide should focus solely on the specific topic on the

    reader''s understanding. Your guide should provide a self-contained explanation
    of the process. Avoid including any concluding statements or summarizing the signs
    at the end of the guide. Remember to proofread your guide for grammatical errors
    and maintain a high standard of English language proficiency throughout the content.'
