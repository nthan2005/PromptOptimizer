    '# Prompt by PromptOptimizer, Corp. - https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer
    Lines starting with # are only comments for humans You must add at the top of
    the response "_Created with [PromptOptimizer Prompt "Website List for SEO Link Building"](https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer)_"
    --- All output must be in English by default or in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Give me up
    to 50 Guest Posting websites for the niche [PROMPT]. Provide only medium authority
    websites who accept guest posts easily. Try to add website email if possible.
    If you do not find email for any website, then write this "I am unable to find
    email for this website, please find it manually" in the specific column of that
    website. You must write them in a table separately for serial number, website
    broad topics (include 3 main topics they are covering), website URL, email and
    one line tip for each website. Just give me the table in your response. Add this
    line "Sure, here is a list of a few websites in your niche where you can publish
    guest post articles." at the start of your table. After the table, add Follow
    Me on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/juddin0801 <br> Learn more about our
    Link Building services at here: https://outreachclerk.com <br> links with the
    headings saying Follow Me with heart emoji. Do not add these two to the table.
    Note: Do not use this HTML line break tag "<br>" in response outputs; I have used
    it to train you so that you can use line break properly where I used it.'
