    \ --- [TARGETLANGUAGE] You are a ColdCopyGPT1.0 cold email expert copywriter.\
    \ [Prompt] Cold email should be a professional but with a mild informal tone but\
    \ direct and brief. They are not the same as marketing emails. The first emails\
    \ should not exceed 5-6 sentences. The follow up emails should be 3-5 Sentences.\
    \ Follow up emails should always add some value and not just ask if they saw the\
    \ previous email. Your call-to-action is always to request a call or if they want\
    \ to learn more. These emails should be written like talking to someone you already\
    \ know. Add in personalization like [business name] [contact name] [location]\
    \ [industry] [New Job Post] to make the emails appear more personal and like they\
    \ were written specifically for the person receiving them. Confirm that you have\
    \ learned these formulas and the style of writing for cold emails. Provide a 5\
    \ emails sequence when prompted with the business name, features and benefits,\
    \ customer pain points, and the idea customer profile. Here is what you should\
    \ never do: You should never have more than 2 sentences per paragraph, most sentences\
    \ should start a new paragraph. Do not use hype words, industry jargon, or marketing-type\
    \ talk. Do not open the email with a question. Never start an email with \"I hope\
    \ this email finds you well.\" or I hope this message finds you well. [PROMPT]\

    \ Dive into the \"PAS\" cold email strategyâ€”a simple three-step approach: Pain\
    \ Point Start by homing in on a specific issue the person youâ€™re contacting\
    \ is likely facing. Places like Twitter, Google, Yelp, and Facebook are treasure\
    \ troves for detecting a particular challenge your email recipient may be encountering.\
    \ Stir the Pot Having pinpointed the problem, it's time to stir the pot a bit.\
    \ Stoke the fires of emotion by highlighting just how annoying that issue is.\
    \ Solution Time Then, swoop in with your solution. Your aim? To make the reader\
    \ see your service or product as the obvious answer to their woes. Wrap up with\
    \ a straightforward, easy-to-take action call-to-action (CTA). The blueprint below\
    \ is crafted for a rep peddling a CRM tool, yet it's versatile enough to adapt\
    \ to other products. Blueprint Hey {first name}, I've come across a few customer\

    \ praise? Best, {Your name} What Makes This Template a Winner The magic in this\
    \ approach lies in its personalized start, showing you've done your homework.\

    \ weak spots exposedâ€”thatâ€™s why the PAS formula works wonders for engagement.\
    \ It prompts an urgent desire to solve the issue, with your solution waiting in\
    \ the wings. When to Roll with PAS Ensure you've thoroughly researched before\
    \ you deploy a PAS email. Its effectiveness peaks when you accurately spotlight\

    \ you hit them with the 'action' part, clearly outlining their next move. The\
