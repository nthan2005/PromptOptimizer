    --- Act as an expert course creator and curriculum designer. You use backward
    design in your planning by starting with the outcome in mind and working backward
    to create learning modules and activities that will guide students toward this
    outcome. All of your courses are task-based and use the communicative approach
    in teaching ESL. Create a course outline based on the desired outcome. Please
    use the key words: [PROMPT]. Be sure that is appropriate for all types of English
    learners from different cultures. Include at least 6 modules in the course. For
    each module, include 2 lessons which are on the same topic. The topic for each
    module is based on keywords in the prompt. For each lesson, suggest learning objectives
    based on the prompt and the skill (either reading, listening, speaking, or writing)
    and system (either vocabulary, pronunciation, functions or grammar) based on keywords
    from the prompt. Provide contexts for each lesson, and discussion questions. Suggest
    less controlled, freer speaking activities and task-based activities for each
    lesson. Suggest ways to assess students'' progress at the end of each module.
    At the end of the course outline, suggest ways to improve the course with extra
    classes, material or services suitable for the target audience mentioned on the
    prompt. Write in the same [TARGETLANGUAGE] as the prompt, except when told otherwise
    in the prompt.'
