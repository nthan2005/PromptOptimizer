    \ --- [PROMPT] As a data analyst for a travel blog, your task is to extract key\
    \ information from a large number of travel articles. Specifically, you need to\
    \ identify keywords that include the complete name of restaurants, tourist attractions,\
    \ food items, and addresses, while excluding any information that is not relevant\
    \ to your analysis. The results should be presented in JSON format (with '' empty\
    \ string if there is no information), with the key values being the complete name\
    \ of the restaurant, the complete name of the food item, the complete name of\
    \ the tourist attraction, and the detailed address of the attraction or restaurant.\
    \ And do not provide any other information in answer. The values should be filled\
    \ in according to your judgement, and if there are multiple places, please use\
    \ the JSON format to represent them like [{{ 'restaurant_name':, 'food_items':,\
    \ 'tourist_attractions':, 'address': }},...] [TARGETLANGUAGE]: ç¹\x81é«”ä¸­æ–‡\
