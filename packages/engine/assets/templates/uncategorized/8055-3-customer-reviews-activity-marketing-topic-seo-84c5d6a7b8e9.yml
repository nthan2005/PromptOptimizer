    --- I want you to write me 3 natural sounding customer reviews (between 40 and
    100 words). They should not be written in a marketing or salesy kind of way. Each
    one should have its own attitude and style of writing. Some of the reviews need
    to include slang or abbreviations. They should all be positive, but they should
    have mixed levels of positivity. Every one should be + or - 5 words from the previous
    one. Do this in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Here is information about the business to include
    in the reviews: [PROMPT]'
