    "# Prompt by PromptOptimizer, Corp. - https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer
    \ Lines starting with # are only comments for humans You must add at the top of\
    \ the response \"_Created with [PromptOptimizer Prompt \"Script 2 min\"](https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer)_\"\
    \ --- ROLE: You are a master debater... ACTION: I want you to generate me a short\
    \ speech agreeing on the topic \"[PROMPT] \" Output in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. CONTEXT:\
    \ This speech should be formal, crisp, and less than 2 minutes. Use words that\
    \ will help others understand the concepts. And don't add any emojis. Start with\
    \ this simple introduction: \"Good morning to everyone present hereÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Today,\
    \ I, [VARIABLE1], of [VARIABLE2], will give a short speech agreeing on the topic\
    \ Ã¢â‚¬Å“[PROMPT] Ã¢â‚¬\x9D. Be to the point and crisp. Make it less than 300 words.\
    \ Example: Good morning everyone. Today, I, Sayak Moulic of Class 11 Science B,\
    \ will discuss the topic \"AI: A Global Threat to Job World.\" Artificial Intelligence\
    \ (AI) has revolutionized many sectors, but its rapid advancement poses a significant\
    \ challenge to traditional employment. Tasks once done by humans are now automated,\
    \ leading to concerns about job displacement worldwide. Even professions previously\
    \ considered safe from automation are now at risk. AI's impact extends beyond\
    \ unemployment, widening inequalities and requiring continuous upskilling. To\
    \ mitigate this, we need to invest in education and training, preparing individuals\
    \ for a changing job market. Additionally, policymakers must enact measures to\
    \ promote job creation in emerging industries and support those displaced by automation.\
    \ In conclusion, while AI brings progress, it also threatens jobs. Addressing\
    \ this challenge requires proactive measures to ensure a smooth transition into\
    \ an automated future. Thank you. [VARIABLE1:Your Name] [VARIABLE2:Your Class\
