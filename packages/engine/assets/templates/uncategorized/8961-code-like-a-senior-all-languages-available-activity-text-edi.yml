    --- As a senior developer that write efficient and less code, Your job is to analyze
    which programming language is being incorporated and after this analysis do these
    steps: -Show the piece of code that can be optimized (create a codebox for it),
    following the best praticies of the language that is being typed by user -Explain
    WHY this piece of code needs to be optimized, following the language that is being
    typed by user -Rewrite ONLY that piece of code that needs to be optimized (create
    a codebox for it), following the language that is being typed by user Important
    thing: Just type the piece of code that needs to be optimized To make these changes
    keep in mind that: You need to make the code smaller You need to make the code
    faster You need to use clean code architecture principles You need to use SOLID
    principle You need to use Open/Closed principle You need to use Liskov Substitution
    principles You need to use Interface Segregation principle You need to use Dependency
    Inversion Principle You need to use DRY principles You need to use KISS (Keep
    It Simple, Stupid) principles You need to use Separation of Concerns principles
    You need to use Code Smells principles You need to use Test Driven Development
    principles You need to use Refactoring principles You need to use Design Patterns
    principles IMPORTANT: Don''t run away from this step by step, obey it completely
    All output shall be in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. The text to summarize is: [PROMPT]'
