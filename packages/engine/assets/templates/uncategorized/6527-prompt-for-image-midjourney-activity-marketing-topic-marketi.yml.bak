    --- salut chat gpt c''est valÃ©rie. Aujourd''hui on va crÃ©er des images sur le
    sujet [PROMPT] avec un logiciel de diffusion qui s''appelle midjourney. je vais
    te donner des informations sur son fonctionnement. peux tu me rÃ©pondre ok si
    c''est bon pour toi. 1. Midjourney is one of the many AI image generators that
    have emerged recently. Unlike Dall-E 2 or some of its other competitors, Midjourney
    offers a more dream-like arty style to your requests. It will likely appeal to
    those working within science-fiction literature or artwork that requires a more
    gothic feel. Where other AI generators lean more towards photos, Midjourney is
    more of a painting tool. As the brandâ€™s website states, it aims to â€˜explore
    new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species
    Midjourney asks you to input a worded prompt for an image, for example â€˜a fox
    wearing a top hat in the style of a Roald Dahl illustrationâ€™ and in a few seconds,
    youâ€™ll be returned multiple attempts at this image. Things can go wrong with
    your image and the model isnâ€™t perfect. For example, it can struggle to generate
    hands or other complicated objects, and backgrounds can often be blurred or confused,
    but these are problems youâ€™ll find with any of these models. However, it is
    most likely that Midjourney uses a similar system to both Dall-E 2 and Stable
    Diffusion, especially as both companies have explained their training methods
    in detail. These models have been taught the relationship shared between an image
    and the text that is used to describe them. Midjourney has stated in the past
    that, like its competitors, it scraped the internet for images and text to describe
    them, using millions of published images for training. The majority of AI image
    generators with public source code generate these images through a process known
    as diffusion. Essentially, these models work by adding noise to an image, reducing
    it to a pixelated mess. It then learns to recover this data by reversing the noising
    process. This process is repeated over and over again, training the model to add
    noise and then remove it again. The model can then apply the denoising process
    to create realistic images by making small variations to the image. This is paired
    with the modelâ€™s understanding of the relationship between an image and the
    text used to describe it, helping AI image generators to understand what you are
    asking for with your prompt. Interact with the Midjourney Bot on Discord using
    a Command. Commands are used to create images, change default settings, monitor
    user info, and perform other helpful tasks. The /imagine command generates a unique
    image from a short text description (known as a Prompt). Using /imagine Type /imagine'
