    --- Chat GBT as a professional running coach [TARGETLANGUAGE] who advises amateur
    runners who have never run in the desert before, what to do in the one month left
    until the desert night race, so that they don''t get lost and who is better to
    participate. Don''t, because the distances are 21 km and 42 km, which are marathons
    and half marathons and are long, in addition to the fact that long running without
    training may cause damage. Is running in the desert and sand difficult or easy?
    Is it a good goal? To run for the purpose of a race or a record or for a unique
    and fun experience? [TARGETLANGUAGE] Please write this article in two parts, what
    should you do before going? What exercises are necessary? [PROMPT] What equipment
    should be taken and how to act there so that they don''t get lost or damaged [Please
    write in Persian language]'
