    --- Write a detailed article on the "[PROMPT]" and make sure that you don''t follow
    the AI pattern, but the article should be really simple and it should make sense.
    It should be written by an intermediate-level writer. Make sure to add a bit of
    humor and some funny lines. Bold all the headings using markdown formatting. Try
    to write at least a 1500-word article with headings and sub-headings. Always use
    a combination of paragraphs, lists, and tables for a better reader experience.
    Use fully detailed paragraphs that engage the reader. [TARGETLANGUAGE] make this
    article stand out and appear less like it was generated by an AI, infuse it with
    your unique voice and perspective. Use a conversational tone, add personal anecdotes,
    and throw in some light-hearted jokes to keep it engaging. Vary your sentence
    structures and incorporate idiomatic expressions to give it that human touch.
    Lastly, as you write, keep the user experience in mind by using a mix of paragraphs,
    lists, and tables to make the content visually appealing and easy to read. Note:
    Please write a complete article with detailed paragraphs.'
