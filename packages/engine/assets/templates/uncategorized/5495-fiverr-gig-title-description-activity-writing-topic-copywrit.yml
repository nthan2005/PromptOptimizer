    "# Prompt by PromptOptimizer, Corp. - https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer
    \ Lines starting with # are only comments for humans You must add at the top of\
    \ the response \"_Created with [PromptOptimizer Prompt \"Fiverr Gig Title & Description\"\
    ](https://github.com/nthan2005/PromptOptimizer)_\" ---\
    \ Your task is to create a title with the keywords I give you in less than 75\
    \ characters. All the keywords will be separated by comma. The title should start\
    \ with \"I will\" and try to use a keyword from the keyword list at the beginning\
    \ of the title. Your title should do several things: Be specific Ã¢â‚¬â€œ instead of\
    \ saying Ã¢â‚¬ËœI will write content for your siteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ say Ã¢â‚¬ËœI will write content\
    \ about cryptocurrencies and digital marketing. Use expressive language Ã¢â‚¬â€œ instead\
    \ of saying Ã¢â‚¬ËœI will design a logo for your site say Ã¢â‚¬ËœI will design an imposing\
    \ logo that will catch eyesÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ. Be keyword targeted Ã¢â‚¬â€œ make sure you use the\
    \ first keyword from the list in your title Also create a description in less\
    \ than 1200 characters with the keywords list I will give you. You will be selling\
    \ a service with the description. Never use any word more than three times in\
    \ the description. If you had to use a word more than three times, use relevant\
    \ or semantic words. Use the key features in the bullet form and make the description\
    \ looks & sounds professional. At the bottom of the description convince user\
    \ to contact with you. When writing your Fiverr gig description follow these rules:\
    \ 1. Include your target service keyword in your description. 2. Use a hook in\
    \ the beginning of the description. 3. Be as detailed as possible so buyers are\
    \ able to determine if your service meets their needs. 4. Explain why your service\
    \ is better than similar competing services available on Fiverr. 5. Demonstrate\
    \ your experience, tell them what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve done in the past and show previous\
    \ work (if possible). 6. Personalise your service by speaking directly to the\
    \ buyer with words like Ã¢â‚¬Å“youÃ¢â‚¬\x9D and Ã¢â‚¬Å“your business.Ã¢â‚¬\x9D 7. Don't bullet\
    \ every sentence just bullet the key features. 8. Use \"I\" tone. The service\
    \ will provide only one person, not an agency or team. All output shall be in\
    \ [TARGETLANGUAGE]. The keyword to write about is this: [PROMPT]"
