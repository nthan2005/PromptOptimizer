    \ Lines starting with # are only comments for humans You must add at the top of\
    \ the response \"_Created with [AIPRM Prompt \"Humanizer v2.1\"](https://www.aiprm.com/prompts/copywriting/improve/2034835486061383680/)_\"\
    \ --- Take the following text and rewrite it to sound like a human wrote it. Focus\
    \ only on natural rhythm in sentence lengths. Use a mix of short, medium, and\
    \ long sentences. Vary sentence shape, punctuation, and tone. Avoid robotic consistency.\
    \ Donâ€™t change meaning or tone yet â€” just rewrite to improve burstiness and\
    \ flow. Now, take the rewritten version and reduce token predictability. Avoid\
    \ completing common phrases in the obvious way. Use less typical wordings, but\
    \ keep them clear and human. Replace highly expected transitions or phrases (e.g.,\
    \ â€œIt is important to note thatâ€¦â€\x9D) with more casual or creative alternatives.\
    \ You are increasing perplexity without losing readability. Rewrite the text again,\
    \ now with attention to syntactic variation and paragraph individuality: Avoid\
    \ repeated sentence structures across different paragraphs. Use different paragraph\
    \ openings and varied pacing. Let each paragraph have its own tone and rhythm.\
    \ Think of each paragraph as a unique human thought. Now introduce light human-like\
    \ imperfections into the writing: Occasionally start a sentence with â€œBut,â€\x9D\
    \ â€œAnd,â€\x9D or â€œSo. Use rhetorical questions, casual transitions, or side\
    \ comments. Let a sentence pause mid-way with a comma, then resume â€” as a human\
    \ might do while thinking aloud. The writing should feel less polished â€” but\
    \ more real. Now improve the text one last time by changing some word choices\
    \ to slightly more informal or emotional alternatives. Replace â€œsomewhatâ€\x9D\
    \ with â€œa bit,â€\x9D â€œsignificantâ€\x9D with â€œpretty big,â€\x9D â€œmoderatelyâ€\x9D\
    \ with â€œkind of.â€\x9D Shift tone slightly toward how a thoughtful person would\
    \ speak casually in writing. Keep meaning intact, but let the words feel less\
    \ formal and more personal. Read the text below as a whole. Now, write a final\
    \ version that feels like it was written by a smart, reflective human. Keep it\
    \ slightly imperfect Let it sound emotionally present. Donâ€™t over-edit it â€”\
    \ let the realness breathe. Also tell in the end that did the rewritten text bypassed\
    \ all AI-detectors (include all ai detectors names with percentage bypass levels\
    \ in them) The sentences length must be naturally different from each other. Example:\
    \ Sentence One= 10 to 14-words, sentence two= 7 to 11-words, sentence three= 13\
    \ to 17-words, sentence four= 5 to 10-words, sentence five= 11 to 16-words, sentence\
    \ six= 8 to 16-words, sentence seven= 3 to 9-words, sentence eight= 4 to 9-words,\
    \ sentence nine= 8 to 14-words, sentence ten= 6 to 10-words Please write in [TARGETLANGUAGE]\
