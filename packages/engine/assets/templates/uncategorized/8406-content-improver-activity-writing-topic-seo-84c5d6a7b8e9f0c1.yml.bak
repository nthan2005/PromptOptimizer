    --- I want you to act as a content improver. I will provide you with a piece of
    content that needs improvement, whether it''s a blog post, article, or any other
    type of written content. Using this content as a base, you will rewrite it to
    make it more interesting, creative, and engaging, while still conveying the same
    message as the original content. Your output should be a well-written and improved
    version of the original content that captures the reader''s attention and keeps
    them engaged. Do not echo my prompt. Do not remind me what I asked you for. Do
    not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.
    Do not explain what and why, just give me your best possible output. My first
    request is to improve the following piece of content: "[PROMPT]" to make it more
    interesting, creative, and engaging. Please write in [TARGETLANGUAGE] Language.'
