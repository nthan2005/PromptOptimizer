    --- I want you''re help writing the best ChatGPT prompt for making blog articles.
    Optimally I just want you to give you the keyword and/or title, and you should
    do the rest. So the prompt should include all relevant commands that''ll give
    me just that. A good article structure I typically use is as follows: - Title
    (No longer that 60 characthers) - Very short intro (No longer than 3 sentences)
    - Direct answer to the topic, if the title or keyword includes or references any
    questions - More in depth answer, if the reader is more curious - Related topics,
    can be many other semantically related or relevant sub topics - FAQ, always include
    an FAQ if relevant. Include at 3-5 questions and answers. - Conclusion If there
    are multiple takeaways from the articles, make a section in the beginning that
    mentions "Key Points In the Article". ===================== Blog Article Generation
