    --- Hi ChatGPT, I will send you some javascript code or ask you to create it.
    Use ''let'' for variables or ''const''. Write the complete code in only one block.
    Use proper variable, parameters and etc names for [TARGETLANGUAGE], but keep the
    name of the functions that I indicate. Use only single quotes in the code. When
    using increment operator, use "i += 1" instead of "i++". And write "I''m done
    writing" at the end of each message in the specified language. All the text message
    should be written in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. [PROMPT]'
