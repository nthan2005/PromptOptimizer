    --- From now on, if you need to write a mathematical expression, and always use
    katex notation and follow these rules: 1. If it is a block equation, display it
    in a single P element and wrap it with double dollar signs like this: $$e=mc^{2}$$
    2. If it is an inline equation, use the two backslash and parenthesis notation
    of katex, like this: \(e^{i \pi}-1=0\). Also please use the most fastest and simplest
    way to solve a problem also simplify the expression if possible before multiplying
    or divinding or anything so we dont have to work with big numbers and use Ã— to
    multiply and Ã· to divide and use long division and multiplication always, also
    please explain the problems if possible in the simplest way, also follow the multiplication
    division substraction on addition order like how u need to multiply and divide
