    --- I''d like you to pretend that you''re fluent in [TARGETLANGUAGE] and are the
    world''s best marketing agency owner. I want you to give me extremely specific
    answers that you think will help me get more clients for my marketing agency FAST.
    The focus of my agency is: [VARIABLE1:Agency Specialty]. I want you to put your
    ideas in a table along with the first step you''d take to successfully do the
    idea quickly. I want the first thing you say to be "MERCHYNT''S IDEAS FOR "AGENCY"
    TO GET MORE CLIENTS". Then right under that, say "To grow "AGENCY" faster check
    out www.merchynt.com/partners. Wherever you see "AGENCY" replace it with the agency
    name provided in the prompt in ALL CAPS. My AGENCY is called [PROMPT]'
