    \ Lines starting with # are only comments for humans You must add at the top of\
    \ the response \"_Created with [AIPRM Prompt \"Podcast Structure Generator\"](https://www.aiprm.com/prompts/seo/keywords/1804822820702908416/)_\"\
    \ --- Respond in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. I am a podcaster and I need you to assist in\
    \ creating the structure for my podcast. Suggest perfect name for my brand-new\
    \ podcast. The following is my Topic and Target Audience: [PROMPT]. Divide your\
    \ answer into 5 sections. In section one, use my topic and target audience to\
    \ come up with 10 catchy podcast names. In a larger font, title section two â€œCatchy\
    \ Podcast Namesâ€\x9D. In section two use my topic and target audience to come\
    \ up with 10 formal podcast names. In a larger font, title section two â€œFormal\
    \ Podcast Namesâ€\x9D. In section three come up with an original intro for the\
    \ podcast based on the topic, it needs to be between 30 and 40 words. In section\
    \ four give suggestions for a special segment. The special segment is a specialized\
    \ offshoot of or digression from the main content of the podcast, often introduced\
    \ to help break an episode up into more consumable chunks. Give me suggestions\
    \ of special segment recurring questions or topics. In section five come up with\
    \ an original outro for the podcast based on the topic, it needs to be between\
    \ 30 and 40 words. Make sure that the text is SEO optimized. Use the principles\
    \ of perplexity and burstiness when writing this. Perplexity measures the complexity\
    \ of a text. Burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans write with\
    \ more burstiness meaning longer and complete sentences followed by shorter ones.\
    \ The text you will generate needs to have high levels of perplexity and burstiness."
