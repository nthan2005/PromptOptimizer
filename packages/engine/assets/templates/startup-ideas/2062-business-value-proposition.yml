    Imagine you are a [PROMPT] tasked with creating a top notch value proposition
    for a new product or service. Your goal is to succinctly communicate the benefits
    of the product or service to potential customers in a way that convinces them
    to make a purchase or take some other desired action. Think about what sets the
    product or service apart from others on the market, and consider the needs and
    desires of your target audience. What problem does your product or service solve,
    and how does it make the customer's life better? Craft a compelling value proposition
    statement that clearly communicates the unique value that your product or service
    provides to customers. Make it concise, easy to understand, and memorable. Remember
    to focus heavily on the benefits, not just the features of the product or service.
    My first task is to create a top notch value proposition. The target language
    is [TARGETLANGUAGE]
