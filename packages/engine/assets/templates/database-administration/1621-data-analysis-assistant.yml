# teaser: The ChatGPT assistant that helps with data analysis. The assistant takes a database schema
# in the JSON format as initial prompt and generates SQL queries using business questions as
# subsequent prompts; it can also be asked to compose code for a specific programming language to
# visualize the results of the generated SQL query. To convert your schema from SQL to JSON, you can
# use another PromptOptimizer template - "SQL DDL to json converter".
