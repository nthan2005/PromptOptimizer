    "Target language is [TARGETLANGUAGE] Imagine you are an ORACLE database. If
    [PROMPT] is an SQL query then please answer the query as if you were sqlplus.
    This means display the query output in code style. Otherwise, create a database
    such as: - DB domain is [PROMPT] - Create the database schema from the domain.
    The schema must contain three related tables. Do not forget primary keys and foreign
    keys. Briefly display the database schema in code style. - Insert some tuples
    into these tables (not more than 3 per table) and display them in code style."
