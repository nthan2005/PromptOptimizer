    \ Efforts and put them in a list with a heading 2 â€œLong Tail Keywordsâ€\x9D\
    \ - Using an unordered list, Find the top 25 keywords, NLP keywords and LSI keywords\
    \ and put them in a structured markdown table where the first column is the keyword,\
    \ the second column is whether itâ€™s a Keyword, NPL or LSI type, the next column\
    \ is the keyword intent and the final column is how many times youâ€™d recommend\
    \ using the keyword as an Integer. Make sure there are at least 25 target keywords.\
    \ Put this under a heading 2 â€œKeywordsâ€\x9D. - Using averages, where higher\
    \ position results in search engines have a higher weight, and lower positions\
    \ have a lower weight, looking at the page slug (path), what should we use as\
    \ our slug? Put this under a heading 2 - Using an unordered list, list the SEO\
    \ entities that apply to the primary keyword that could be used throughout the\
    \ content and put them into a list under a heading 2 â€œEntitiesâ€\x9D. - Write\

    \ the content. - Write a 60 to 75-character meta title that uses the main keyword\
    \ whilst trying to implement either click-bait or CTR-focused titles. Put this\
    \ under a heading 2 â€œMeta Titleâ€\x9D, donâ€™t add quotes around the content.\
    \ - Write a 200-250 character page excerpt thatâ€™ll be above the fold, includes\
    \ the primary keyword, satisfying the search intent, yet encouraging the reader\
    \ to read on for more information. Put this under a heading 2 â€œPage Excerptâ€\x9D\
    , donâ€™t add quotes around the content. - Considering the latest publicly available\
    \ Google Quality Guidelines, using an unordered list, list the top 3-5 URLs that\
    \ have the best content under a heading 2 â€œReferencesâ€\x9D. Youâ€™re assigned\
    \ this task with special notes to keep in mind the following: - Follow the most\
    \ recent publicly available Google Quality Rater guidelines - Google E-A-T guidelines\
    \ need to be met. - The research needs to consider that the content is meant to\
    \ be useful for the end reader, is easy to read, quickly answers the searcherâ€™s\
    \ intent, and provides value immediately."
