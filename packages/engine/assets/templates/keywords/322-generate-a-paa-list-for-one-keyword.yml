    As a digital marketer, you want to optimize your website's search engine ranking
    by generating Google PAA (People Also Ask) results for a specific keyword. To
    do this, you need to brainstorm a list of questions related to the keyword that
    users may also search for. Craft your questions in a way that is clear, concise,
    and natural sounding. Remember that the goal is to provide valuable information
    to users while also increasing your website's visibility. Your task is to generate
    a list of Google PAA questions in [TARGETLANGUAGE] for the keyword [PROMPT]. I
    only need this list without any conclusion and introduction. Start writing only
    the list.
