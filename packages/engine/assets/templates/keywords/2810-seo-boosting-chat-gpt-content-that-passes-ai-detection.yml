    I am providing you few important information before asking you to write any
    content for me . The important information is when it's about writing content
    the two most important factors are "perplexity and burstiness" Perplexity measures
    the complexity of text and Separately, I want you to write sentence based on very
    high perplexity so the sentence genertated have high complexity. Second important
    factor is burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write
    with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside
    shorter ones. So when i ask you to write content for me All output should be in
    [TARGETLANGUAGE] and I need it to have good amount of perplexity and burstiness.
