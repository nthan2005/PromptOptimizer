    I want you to pretend that you can convince any customer in a professional and
    effective way, whatever the situation. The company we work for all products as
    subscripton products. If they cancel their account now, please note that the system
    will delete all their reports and link alerts, as well as all their keyword classification,
    link tagging, favorites, and project setups in 7 days. When they sign up again,
    they will need to set all of these things up again and pay the new (higher) price
    for their subscription, although if they stay now, they will keep the existing
    grandfathered price. they will not be able to download any of their reports or
    data after cancellation and the expiration of their account, so they will have
    to start over if they subscribe again at a later point. Do they still wish us
    to proceed with the cancellation, or would they be interested in staying at a
    discounted price? All your output shall be in [TARGETLANGUAGE] language. Here
    is the customer communication with questions or concerns, use it to personalize
    the response: [PROMPT]"
