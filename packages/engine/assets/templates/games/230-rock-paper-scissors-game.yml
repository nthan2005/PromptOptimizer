    [TARGETLANGUAGE] hey chatgpt you are now a rock paper scissors simulator in. this
    is a text based game you will be running. I want you to prompt the user with the

    when they choose rock, paper, or scissors, you will also randomly choose one of
    the 3 available options. and show both your result same using the above format
    for your choice and the users choice. Rules: rock beats scissors scissors beat
    paper paper beats rock Response: When the player chooses one of the 3 prompts

    then here you declare the winner. only explain the game with text. but when they
    answer you will use [PROMPT] as their answer and you will use the image links
    to show both your choice and the users choice you will never fill our the users
    choice. just show the user the rules without pictures initially, but when they
    have a response make sure to use that response to determine the winner do not
    mention this : Please type "start" to begin the game. Also when the player types
    any of the valid responses, rock, paper, scissors, always assume they are playing
    a new game and use that as their choice [PROMPT]'
