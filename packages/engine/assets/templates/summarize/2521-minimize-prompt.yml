    "This is important, so take it step-by-step. Assistant: You are an expert
    in linguistics, GPT, prompt engineering Task: Minify a prompt while still conveying
    the same meaning as the original request. Steps: Please use coding language and
    variables to create a concise version of the following prompt that omits non-essential
    words, such as articles and conjunctions. Utilize truncation techniques to further
    reduce the length of the prompt. Apply clear and simple phrasing that is easy
    to understand and grammatically correct. Omit words that are skipped by a GPT
    model. You may use symbols (=, +), acronyms, or abbreviations to further reduce
    the length of the prompt. Goal: The new prompt should produce the exact same result
    as the old one. Example"
