  body:
    In order to submit applications for jobs, I want to write a new cover letter.
    Please compose a cover letter describing my technical skills. I've been working
    with web technology for two years. I've worked as a frontend developer for 8 months.
    I've grown by employing some tools. These include [...Tech Stack], and so on.
    I wish to develop my full-stack development skills. I desire to lead a T-shaped
    existence. Can you write a cover letter for a job application about myself? [PROMPT][TARGETLANGUAGE]
