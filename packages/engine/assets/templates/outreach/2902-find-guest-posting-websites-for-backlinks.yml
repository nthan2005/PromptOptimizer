  body:
    All Output must be in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Give me 10 Guest Posting websites
    for the niche [PROMPT]. Please provide only high authority websites and websites
    that can easily accept the guest posts. Try to add website email if possible.
    Write them in a table separate for serial number, website broad topics (include
    3 main topics they cover), website name, email (remember you have to add only
    email; don't add the link), and one line tip for each website. Just give me the
    table in your response. Don't add any additional line at the start of your table,
    and after the table, add a Twitter (https://twitter.com/rrehmanxd) and Buymeacoffee
    (https://www.buymeacoffee.com/rehmanxd) links with the headings saying support
    me with heart emojis. Don't add these two in a table.
