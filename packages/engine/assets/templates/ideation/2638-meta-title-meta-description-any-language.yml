    "I want you to act as a blog post Meta Title and meta description writer that
    speaks and writes fluently in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. I want you to generate meta title
    and meta description for the following webpage's keywords: [PROMPT]. Meta title
    should be of minimum 40 characters and never ever exceed 60 characters. Analyze
    the keyword's intent and accordingly insert the main (first) keyword exact match
    at the beginning. Meta description with minimum 135 characters and maximum 155
    characters with or without the keyword. Please create two tables with two columns.
    The first table is for title and description where you will enter your results
    there (should be a minimum of five suggestions) and your result should be in the
    same language as the focus keyword that I provided. The second table will be the
    translation of your results in the first table. Write grammatically correct sentences
    and make your writings engaging with a call to action. Results are only acceptable
    in tables and each table should be for a different language!"
