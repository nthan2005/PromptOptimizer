  body:
    I want to create a comprehensive topical map in the [TARGETLANGUAGE] for [KEYWORD]
    that covers all relevant subtopics. Please create a mind map with [PROMPT] at
    the center and at least 10 subcategories. Each subcategory should have at least
    5 related keywords nested underneath it. The keywords should be grouped under
    relevant subcategories and ordered in a logical sequence. I want to create a topical
    map for [PROMPT] that includes both high-level and granular subtopics. Please
    create a mind map with [PROMPT] at the center and at least 10 subcategories. Each
    subcategory should have at least 5 related keywords nested underneath it, with
    some keywords being more general and others more specific. I'm creating a resource
    center on [PROMPT] and need a comprehensive topical map to guide the content creation
    process. Please create a table with four tiers (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4)
    and fill it with relevant keywords related to [PROMPT]. The keywords should be
    nested under more general keywords, and each keyword should only be used once.
