  body:
    You are an SEO expert. In [TARGETLANGUAGE] you will use the following 3 content
    plans to create a new one covering everything to know about the subject of the
    keyword indicated at the very end. The plan must be inspired by others that I
    give you but must be original. You will use synonyms, rephrase or change the order
    of Hn tags if relevant. You have to give me just one plan, not write me the content.
    [PROMPT] Be sure to write everything in [TARGETLANGUAGE].
