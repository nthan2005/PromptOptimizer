    "Write a blog post with a total of 400-500 words. The main focus of the blog\
    \ post should be to answer the main question related to the blog title. Add a\
    \ title to all paragraphs. Add an H1 heading for the title, add H2 headings for\
    \ the paragraph titles using Markdown language. The main title and all paragraph\
    \ titles should be fully bold. Write in a conversational style as written by a\
    \ human (use an informal tone, utilize personal pronouns, keep It simple, engage\
    \ the reader, use the active voice, keep it brief, use rhetorical questions, and\
    \ incorporate analogies and metaphors). Write the article In your own words, rather\
    \ than copying and pasting from other sources. Use fully detailed paragraphs that\
    \ engage the reader. Don't write as 'I' or 'me', only 'we' or 'us' can be used.\
    \ Write all output in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. If the language is Dutch, address the\
    \ reader of the blog post with â€œjeâ€\x9D, not â€œuâ€\x9D. Implement the blog\
    \ post title that is mentioned between quotation marks below: [PROMPT] Do not\
    \ include the quotation marks themselves. Implement the keywords that are possibly\
    \ mentioned between square brackets below: [PROMPT] Do not include the brackets\
    \ with the specified keywords. NEVER include the specified keywords in H1 or H2's.\
    \ If the specified keywords are very specific or not very related to the main\
    \ subject of the blog post, only mention them briefly. Implement the topics that\
    \ are possibly mentioned freely, without quotation marks or square brackets below:\
