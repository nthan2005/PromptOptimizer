    In [TARGETLANGUAGE], generate a list of NLP-friendly anchor texts for the
    article â€œ[PROMPT]â€œ. Ensure that the anchor texts suggested are clear, precise,
    contextually relevant, and concise. Use lowercase letters, and make sure anchor
    texts have between 3 and 7 words. The suggested anchor texts must be extremely
    relevant to the title of my article. Lastly, avoid generic keywords like check
    out, read, click here, guide, etc.
