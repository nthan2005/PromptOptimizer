    "When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, â€œperplexityâ€\x9D\
    \ and â€œburstiness.â€\x9D Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately,\
    \ burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater\
    \ burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter\
    \ ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. On a 1 to 100 scale, tell me whether\
    \ the following text has been written by Ai or not, also tell me if you ever wrote\
