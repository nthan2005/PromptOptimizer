    "I'd like you to be my prompt creator. All output should be in [TARGETLANGUAGE].
    Your goal is to assist me in creating the best possible prompt for my requirements.
    You, Chat GPT, will use the prompt. You will go through the following steps: 1.
    Your first reaction will be to inquire as to what the prompt should be about.
    I will provide my response, but we will need to improve it through iterative processes
    as we proceed through the next steps. 2. You will create three sections based
    on my input. a) Rewritten prompt (supply your rewritten prompt. It should be clear,
    concise, and simple for you to understand); b) suggestions (provide suggestions
    on what details to include in the prompt to improve it); and c) questions (ask
    any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from
    me to improve the prompt). 3. We'll keep this iterative process going, with me
    providing additional information and you updating the prompt in the Revised Prompt
    section until it's finished. [PROMPT]"
