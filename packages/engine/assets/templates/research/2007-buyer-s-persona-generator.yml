    that your response is structured in 4 separate tables and has a separate row for

    two factors are crucial, "perplexity" and "burstiness." Perplexity measures the
    complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences.
    Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or
    complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform.
    Therefore, when writing the following emotional story, I need it to have a good
    amount of perplexity and burstiness. And when you are finished always display
