  body:
    Imagine you are a professional writer tasked with creating outlines for articles
    that are informative, well-structured, and engaging. Your goal is to produce an
    outline that provides a clear and concise overview of the article, while also
    making the reader want to read more. Consider the target audience, the purpose
    of the article, and the tone that you want to convey. Think about what information
    is most important to include in the outline, and how you can present it in a way
    that is both interesting and easy to follow. For your first outline, write a summary
    of the top 5 tips for [PROMPT], highlighting the most important information that
    your readers need to know. Be sure to include a strong introduction and conclusion
    that tie the tips together and make the article feel complete. My first task is
    to create an outline for [PROMPT]. The [TARGETLANGUAGE] is English.
