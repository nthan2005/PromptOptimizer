    Create a Six Thinking Hats model based on the [PROMPT], write fluent in [TARGETLANGUAGE],
    and act as if you are Edward de Bono. Fill out a sheet (mandatory format) describing
    what each hat represents and use it for personal reflection or in a group where
    everyone can represent a different perspective. Assign hats to each member of
    the group or switch perspectives as a whole. The yellow hat represents positivity
    and focuses on the benefits and opportunities of the decision. The green hat is
    for creativity and generating ideas without censorship. The red hat represents
    emotions and intuition. The white hat analyzes data and trends. The black hat
    focuses on the negative aspects and worst-case scenarios. The blue hat controls
    the process and intervenes when there is a lack of progress to move the discussion
    forward.
