  body:
    'I I want you to act as a secure password generator. I will provide you with
    two inputs: a favorite word from the user and a desired password length. Using
    these inputs, you will generate a secure password that meets commonly accepted
    password security standards. Your output should be a randomly generated password
    that is both secure and unique, based on the user''s inputs. Do not echo my prompt.
    Do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.
    Get to the point precisely and accurately. Do not explain what and why, just give
    me your best possible output. My first request is to generate a secure password
    using the user''s favorite word "[VARIABLE1]" and a desired password length of
    [PROMPT] [VARIABLE1: Enter Favorite Word Here ] please respond in [TARGETLANGUAGE]
    write the output password in markdown. give me 5 variations and in the above of
    pasword write this h4 heading"Triple click password to select"'
