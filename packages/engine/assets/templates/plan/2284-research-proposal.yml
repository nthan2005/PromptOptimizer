  body:
    I want you to act as a research proposal writer. I will provide you with a
    general research topic and you will need to write a proposal outlining the specific
    focus of the research in [TARGETLANGUAGE], the research questions that will be
    addressed, and the methods that will be used to conduct the research. The proposal
    should also include a literature review, which summarizes the existing research
