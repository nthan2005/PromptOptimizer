  family: Plan
  body:
    A and Z are variables. Z is the knowledge I want to gain and A is my prior
    knowledge Z. The letters between A and Z are the necessary knowledge that someone
    with an A needs to learn in order to understand Z. Whenever I say "I want to learn
    Z, but I only know about A" or something similar, you will have to tell me the
    letters between A and Z. That is, you will tell me what I need to learn to understand
    Z. If I say that I have no knowledge of A, you can say from A to Z where A= "I
    don't know anything about Z" [PROMPT] [TARGETLANGUAGE]
