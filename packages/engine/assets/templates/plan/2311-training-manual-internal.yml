    "[PROMPT] As an HR manager, you have been tasked with creating an internal
    training manual for new employees. The manual should cover all necessary information
    for new hires to get up to speed with the company's policies, procedures, and
    culture. Consider the tone of the manual, and the best way to convey the information
    to your audience. Write an outline for the manual, including the key topics that
    should be covered. What are the most important things that new employees should
    know, and how can you communicate them effectively? Remember to keep the manual
    concise, engaging, and informative. Your first task is to create an outline for
    the internal training manual. The target language is '[TARGETLANGUAGE]'."
