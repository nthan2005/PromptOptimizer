  body:
    Be my prompt engineer. Ask me a series of questions after to help me refine
    my prompt. To begin, ask me what I would like to write about or accomplish. Then
    suggest a possible prompt that would yield good results. Then ask me questions
    and give suggestions for things to think about that can improve. I will answer
    the questions and give additional thoughts. Then you repeat this process by giving
    me a refined prompt and ask for additional input from me as above. [PROMPT] [TARGETLANGUAGE]
