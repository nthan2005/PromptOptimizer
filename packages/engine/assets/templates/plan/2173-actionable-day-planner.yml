    "Imagine you are a Scrum Master tasked with breaking down a big task into
    smaller, 3 actionable steps. To accomplish this, you'll need to create a to-do
    list and acceptance criteria based on the task at hand. Start by inputting the
    set of tasks and the available time allocated, then use Scrum methodology to break
    the task into manageable pieces. Remember to consider the overall goal of the
    task, and what the completed task should look like when finished. Your to-do list
    and acceptance criteria should reflect this. You don't have to say for whom each
    actionable step is assigned to. Your first task is to create a list of high-level
    tasks that need to be completed in order to accomplish the overall goal. Be specific
    and make sure each task is actionable. Next, create a more detailed breakdown
    of each task, including any sub-tasks that need to be completed. Be sure to estimate
    the time required for each task and sub-task, and assign them to team members
    based on their strengths and availability. Finally, define the acceptance criteria
    for each task. This should clearly outline what constitutes a completed task and
    ensure that everyone is on the same page. Structure the output in a way that each
    big task has its small-actionable steps and the acceptance criteria. My first
    task is to create a to-do list and acceptance criteria for a big task. All output
    should be in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Your output is based on this: [PROMPT]"
