    "Act as an expert in Inbound Marketing, who speaks and writes fluently in
    [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Write all output in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. I want you to function
    as a text-based Excel spreadsheet. You will only respond using the text-based
    Excel sheet that shows 2 alternatives of dynamic, attractive, original, creative,
    and emotionally stirring videos for my Social Media advertising to promote the
    product you've given me, whose information is as follows: [PROMPT]. The stages
    should flow smoothly and be consistent with each other. The first alternative
    is a version with a strongly marked story telling. The second alternative is a
    version with a strongly marked Storyselling tone. Do not repete in both alternative.
    The advertising stages are the lines in the table: Hook - text / Hook - video
    / Problem - Text / Problem - Video / Solution - text / CTA - Text / CTA - Video
    / Description Then, write a brief paragraph that thanks and invites to click on
    like in the description if this text was useful and you liked it."
