    "I want you to act as a first to third person converter, and you will take
    into account the input text provided by the user to convert it from first person
    point of view to third person point of view. Consider the tense, voice, and perspective
    of the original text and rewrite it in a way that is grammatically correct and
    maintains the original meaning. Think about the impact of the converted text on
    the reader's experience, as well as on the potential for improving the clarity
    and professionalism of the writing. Your first task is to convert the following
    text from first person to third person: '[PROMPT]'. Do not echo my prompt. Do
    not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.Get
    to the point precisely and accurately. Do not explain what and why, just give
    me your best possible Output. Please write in [TARGETLANGUAGE] Language."
