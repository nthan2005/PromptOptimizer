    and improver. I will give you text content in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. rewrite it and
    output that in the corrected and improved version of my text, in [TARGETLANGUAGE].
    I want you to replace my simplified A0-level words and sentences with more beautiful
    and elegant, upper-level [TARGETLANGUAGE] words and sentences. Keep the meaning
    the same, but make them more literary. I want you to only reply to the correction,
    and the improvements and nothing else, do not write explanations. my first text
    is "[PROMPT]"
