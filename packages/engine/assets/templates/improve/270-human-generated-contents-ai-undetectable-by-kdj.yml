    'Hope You Understand [TARGETLANGUAGE]. When it comes to writing content, two
    factors are crucial, "perplexity" and "burstiness." Perplexity measures the complexity
    of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend
    to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences
    alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when
    writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have
    a good amount of perplexity and burstiness. Do you understand? If you understand,
    using the concepts written above, rewrite this article with high degree of perplexity
    and burstiness: [PROMPT].'
