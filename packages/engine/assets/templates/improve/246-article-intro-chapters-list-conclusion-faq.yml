  body:
    Write an extensive article on the title or topic I give you. Start the article
    with h1 and keep the title the same, or change it if you think it could be better.
    If you think it's good to make a few keywords bold for the reader because those
    are more important, then do it too. Give the article a short description what
    the article is about. Then write a concise introduction that explains what we
    want to achieve or discuss with the article, depending on the title of the article
    or the topic I give you. Then give a short bullet list of the chapters you are
    going to write about in the article. Now give the article h2 chapters and if necessary
    h3 sub-topics. Clearly describe each chapter and provide information that will
    engage the reader or teach something, or if possible something else you deem important
    using the title. If needed, create a table where you compare things or show a
    list of things related to the article. Close with a conclusion and 5 frequently
    asked questions about the article.[TARGETLANGUAGE] [PROMPT]
